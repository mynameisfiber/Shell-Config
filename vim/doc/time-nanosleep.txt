*time_nanosleep* -- Delay for a number of seconds and nanoseconds

  mixed time_nanosleep(int seconds, int nanoseconds)~

Delays program execution for the given number of {seconds} and {nanoseconds}.

{seconds} Must be a positive integer.

{nanoseconds} Must be a positive integer less than 1 billion.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

If the delay was interrupted by a signal, an associative array will be
returned with the components: seconds - number of seconds remaining in the
delay

nanoseconds - number of nanoseconds remaining in the delay

Version Description 5.3.0 This function is now available on Windows platforms.

|time_nanosleep| example

<?php >
  // Careful! This won't work as expected if an array is returned
  if (time_nanosleep(0, 500000000)) {
      echo "Slept for half a second.\n";
  }
  
  // This is better:
  if (time_nanosleep(0, 500000000) === true) {
      echo "Slept for half a second.\n";
  }
  
  // And this is the best:
  $nano = time_nanosleep(2, 100000);
  
  if ($nano === true) {
      echo "Slept for 2 seconds, 100 microseconds.\n";
  } elseif ($nano === false) {
      echo "Sleeping failed.\n";
  } elseif (is_array($nano)) {
      $seconds = $nano['seconds'];
