*stream_set_timeout* -- Set timeout period on a stream

  bool stream_set_timeout(resource stream, int seconds [, int microseconds])~

Sets the timeout value on {stream}, expressed in the sum of {seconds} and
{microseconds}.

When the stream times out, the 'timed_out' key of the array returned by
|stream_get_meta_data| is set to TRUE, although no error/warning is generated.

{stream} The target stream.

{seconds} The seconds part of the timeout to be set.

{microseconds} The microseconds part of the timeout to be set.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

Version Description 4.3.0 As of PHP 4.3, this function can (potentially) work
on any kind of stream. In PHP 4.3, socket based streams are still the only
kind supported in the PHP core, although streams from other extensions may
support this function.

|stream_set_timeout| example

<?php >
  $fp = fsockopen("www.example.com", 80);
  if (!$fp) {
      echo "Unable to open\n";
  } else {
  
      fwrite($fp, "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n");
      stream_set_timeout($fp, 2);
      $res = fread($fp, 2000);
  
      $info = stream_get_meta_data($fp);
      fclose($fp);
  
      if ($info['timed_out']) {
          echo 'Connection timed out!';
      } else {
          echo $res;
      }
  
  }
?>





This function doesn't work with advanced operations like
|stream_socket_recvfrom|, use |stream_select| with timeout parameter instead.

This function was previously called as |set_socket_timeout| and later
|socket_set_timeout| but this usage is deprecated.
