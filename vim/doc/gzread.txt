stops when {length} (uncompressed) bytes have been read or EOF is reached,
whichever comes first.

{zp} The gz-file pointer. It must be valid, and must point to a file
successfully opened by |gzopen|.

{length} The number of bytes to read.

The data that have been read.

<?php >
  // get contents of a gz-file into a string
  $filename = "/usr/local/something.txt.gz";
  $zd = gzopen($filename, "r");
  $contents = gzread($zd, 10000);
  gzclose($zd);
?>
