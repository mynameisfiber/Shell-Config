Array of meta data about session cache or FALSE on failure

The array returned by this function contains the following elements:
total_cache_uptime - total time in seconds that the session cache has been
active

total_item_count - total number of elements that are currently in the session
cache

is_local_cache - true is the cache metadata is for a local cache instance,
false if the metadata is for the global cache

total_hit_count - number of times the data has been served from the cache

total_miss_count - number of times the data has not been found in the cache

scache_entries - an array that contains the information about all the cached
items: key_name - name of the key which is used to store the data

value_type - type of value stored by the key

use_time - time in seconds since the file has been accessed in the opcode
cache

last_check - time in seconds since the file has been checked for modifications

ttl_seconds - time remaining for the data to live in the cache, 0 meaning
infinite

age_seconds - time elapsed from the time data has been added in the cache

hitcount - number of times data has been served from the cache

A |wincache_scache_info| example

  <pre>
<?php >
  print_r(wincache_scache_info());
?>
  </pre>

The above example will output:
