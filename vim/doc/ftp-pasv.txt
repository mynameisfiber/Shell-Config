*ftp_pasv* -- Turns passive mode on or off

  bool ftp_pasv(resource ftp_stream, bool pasv)~

|ftp_pasv| turns on or off passive mode. In passive mode, data connections are
initiated by the client, rather than by the server. It may be needed if the
client is behind firewall.

Please note that |ftp_pasv| can only be called after a successfull login or
otherwise it will fail.

{ftp_stream} The link identifier of the FTP connection.

{pasv} If TRUE, the passive mode is turned on, else it's turned off.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

|ftp_pasv| example

<?php >
  $file = 'somefile.txt';
  $remote_file = 'readme.txt';
  
  // set up basic connection
  $conn_id = ftp_connect($ftp_server);
  
  // login with username and password
  $login_result = ftp_login($conn_id, $ftp_user_name, $ftp_user_pass);
  
  // turn passive mode on
  ftp_pasv($conn_id, true);
  
  // upload a file
  if (ftp_put($conn_id, $remote_file, $file, FTP_ASCII)) {
   echo "successfully uploaded $file\n";
  } else {
   echo "There was a problem while uploading $file\n";
  }
  
  // close the connection
  ftp_close($conn_id);
?>
