*DomNode->replace_node* -- Replaces node

  domelement DomNode->replace_node(domelement newnode)~

(PHP 4.2) This function replaces an existing node with the passed new node.
Before the replacement {newnode} is copied if it has a parent to make sure a
node which is already in the document will not be inserted a second time. This
behaviour enforces doing all modifications on the node before the replacement
or to refetch the inserted node afterwards with functions like
|domnode_first_child|, |domnode_child_nodes| etc..

(PHP 4.3) This function replaces an existing node with the passed new node. It
is not copied anymore. If {newnode} was already inserted in the document it is
first unlinked from its existing context. If the replacement succeeds the old
node is returned.
