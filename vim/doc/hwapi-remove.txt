*hw_api->remove* -- Delete an object

  bool remove(array parameter)~

Removes an object from the specified parent. Collections will be removed
recursively.

{parameter} You can pass an optional object query to remove only those objects
which match the query. An object will be deleted physically if it is the last
instance.

The parameter array contains the required elements 'objectidentifier' and
'parentidentifier'. If you want to remove a user or group 'parentidentifier'
can be skipped.

The optional parameter 'mode' determines how the deletion is performed. In
normal mode the object will not be removed physically until all instances are
removed. In physical mode all instances of the object will be deleted
immediately. In removelinks mode all references to and from the objects will
be deleted as well. In nonrecursive the deletion is not performed recursive.
Removing a collection which is not empty will cause an error.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.
