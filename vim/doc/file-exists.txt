*file_exists* -- Checks whether a file or directory exists

  bool file_exists(string filename)~

Checks whether a file or directory exists.

{filename} Path to the file or directory.

On windows, use //computername/share/filename or \\computername\share\filename
to check files on network shares.

Returns TRUE if the file or directory specified by {filename} exists; FALSE
otherwise.

This function will return FALSE for symlinks pointing to non-existing files.

This function returns FALSE for files inaccessible due to safe mode
restrictions. However these files still can be included if they are located in
safe_mode_include_dir.

The check is done using the real UID/GID instead of the effective one.

Testing whether a file exists

<?php >
  $filename = '/path/to/foo.txt';
  
  if (file_exists($filename)) {
      echo "The file $filename exists";
  } else {
      echo "The file $filename does not exist";
  }
?>





Upon failure, an E_WARNING is emitted.

The results of this function are cached. See |clearstatcache| for more
details.

As of PHP 5.0.0, this function can also be used with some URL wrappers. Refer
to for a listing of which wrappers support |stat| family of functionality.
