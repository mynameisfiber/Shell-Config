*mcrypt_encrypt* -- Encrypts plaintext with given parameters

  string mcrypt_encrypt(string cipher, string key, string data, string mode [, string iv])~

Encrypts the data and returns it.

{cipher} One of the MCRYPT_ciphername constants, or the name of the algorithm
as string.

{key} The key with which the data will be encrypted. If it's smaller than the
required keysize, it is padded with '\0'. It is better not to use ASCII
strings for keys.

It is recommended to use the mhash functions to create a key from a string.

{data} The data that will be encrypted with the given {cipher} and {mode}. If
the size of the data is not n * blocksize, the data will be padded with '\0'.

The returned crypttext can be larger than the size of the data that was given
by {data}.

{mode} One of the MCRYPT_MODE_modename constants, or one of the following
strings: "ecb", "cbc", "cfb", "ofb", "nofb" or "stream".

{iv} Used for the initialization in CBC, CFB, OFB modes, and in some
algorithms in STREAM mode. If you do not supply an IV, while it is needed for
an algorithm, the function issues a warning and uses an IV with all its bytes
set to '\0'.

Returns the encrypted data, as a string.

|mcrypt_encrypt| Example

<?php >
      $iv_size = mcrypt_get_iv_size(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256, MCRYPT_MODE_ECB);
      $iv = mcrypt_create_iv($iv_size, MCRYPT_RAND);
      $key = "This is a very secret key";
      $text = "Meet me at 11 o'clock behind the monument.";
      echo strlen($text) . "\n";
  
      $crypttext = mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256, $key, $text, MCRYPT_MODE_ECB, $iv);
      echo strlen($crypttext) . "\n";
?>

The above example will output:

  42
  64
