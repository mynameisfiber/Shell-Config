*mcrypt_get_iv_size* -- Returns the size of the IV belonging to a specific
cipher/mode combination

  int mcrypt_get_iv_size(string cipher, string mode)~

Gets the size of the IV belonging to a specific {cipher}/{mode} combination.

It is more useful to use the |mcrypt_enc_get_iv_size| function as this uses
the resource returned by |mcrypt_module_open|.

{cipher} One of the MCRYPT_ciphername constants, or the name of the algorithm
as string.

{mode} One of the MCRYPT_MODE_modename constants, or one of the following
strings: "ecb", "cbc", "cfb", "ofb", "nofb" or "stream". The IV is ignored in
ECB mode as this mode does not require it. You will need to have the same IV
(think: starting point) both at encryption and decryption stages, otherwise
your encryption will fail.

Returns the size of the Initialization Vector (IV) in bytes. On error the
function returns FALSE. If the IV is ignored in the specified cipher/mode
combination zero is returned.

|mcrypt_get_iv_size| Example

<?php >
      echo mcrypt_get_iv_size(MCRYPT_CAST_256, MCRYPT_MODE_CFB) . "\n";
  
      echo mcrypt_get_iv_size('des', 'ecb') . "\n";
?>
