*svn_add* -- Schedules the addition of an item in a working directory

  bool svn_add(string path [, bool recursive [, bool force]])~

Adds the file, directory or symbolic link at {path} to the working directory.
The item will be added to the repository the next time you call |svn_commit|
on the working copy.

{path} Path of item to add.

Relative paths will be resolved as if the current working directory was the
one that contains the PHP binary. To use the calling script"s working
directory, use |realpath| or dirname(__FILE__).

{recursive} If item is directory, whether or not to recursively add all of its
contents. Default is TRUE

{force} If true, Subversion will recurse into already versioned directories in
order to add unversioned files that may be hiding in those directories.
Default is FALSE

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

|svn_add| example In a working directory where svn status returns:

  $ svn status
  ?      foobar.txt

...this code:

<?php >
  svn_add('foobar.txt');
?>

...will schedule foobar.txt for addition into the repository.
