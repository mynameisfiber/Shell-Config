*zip_entry_open* -- Open a directory entry for reading

  bool zip_entry_open(resource zip, resource zip_entry [, string mode])~

Opens a directory entry in a zip file for reading.

{zip} A valid resource handle returned by |zip_open|.

{zip_entry} A directory entry returned by |zip_read|.

{mode} Any of the modes specified in the documentation of |fopen|.

Currently, {mode} is ignored and is always "rb". This is due to the fact that
zip support in PHP is read only access.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

Unlike |fopen| and other similar functions, the return value of
|zip_entry_open| only indicates the result of the operation and is not needed
for reading or closing the directory entry.

|zip_entry_close| |zip_entry_read|
