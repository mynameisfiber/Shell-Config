*spliti* -- Split string into array by regular expression case insensitive

  array spliti(string pattern, string string [, int limit])~

Splits a {string} into array by regular expression.

This function is identical to |split| except that this ignores case
distinction when matching alphabetic characters.

This function has been DEPRECATED as of PHP 5.3.0. Relying on this feature is
highly discouraged.

{pattern} Case insensitive regular expression.

If you want to split on any of the characters which are considered special by
regular expressions, you'll need to escape them first. If you think |spliti|
(or any other regex function, for that matter) is doing something weird,
please read the file regex.7, included in the regex/ subdirectory of the PHP
distribution. It's in manpage format, so you'll want to do something along the
lines of man /usr/local/src/regex/regex.7 in order to read it.

{string} The input string.

{limit} If {limit} is set, the returned array will contain a maximum of
{limit} elements with the last element containing the whole rest of {string}.

Returns an array of strings, each of which is a substring of {string} formed
by splitting it on boundaries formed by the case insensitive regular
expression {pattern}.

If there are n occurrences of {pattern}, the returned array will contain n+1
items. For example, if there is no occurrence of {pattern}, an array with only
one element will be returned. Of course, this is also true if {string} is
empty. If an error occurs, |spliti| returns FALSE.

This example splits a string using 'a' as the separator : |spliti| example

<?php >
  $string = "aBBBaCCCADDDaEEEaGGGA";
  $chunks = spliti ("a", $string, 5);
  print_r($chunks);
?>

The above example will output:

  Array
  (
    [0] =>
    [1] => BBB
    [2] => CCC
    [3] => DDD
    [4] => EEEaGGGA
  )



As of PHP 5.3.0, the regex extension is deprecated in favor of the PCRE
extension. Calling this function will issue an E_DEPRECATED notice. See the
list of differences for help on converting to PCRE.
