*px_set_blob_file* -- Sets the file where blobs are read from

  bool px_set_blob_file(resource pxdoc, string filename)~

Sets the name of the file where blobs are going to be read from or written
into. Without calling this function, |px_get_record| or |px_retrieve_record|
will only return data in blob fields if the data is part of the record and not
stored in the blob file. Blob data is stored in the record if it is small
enough to fit in the size of the blob field.

Calling |px_put_record|, |px_insert_record|, or |px_update_record| without
calling |px_set_blob_file| will result in truncated blob fields unless the
data fits into the database file.

Calling this function twice will close the first blob file and open the new
one.

{pxdoc} Resource identifier of the paradox database as returned by |px_new|.

{filename} The name of the file. Its extension should be .MB.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.
