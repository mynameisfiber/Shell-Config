Version Description 5.3.1 |rename| can now rename files across drives in
Windows. 5.0.0 |rename| can now also be used with some URL wrappers. Refer to
for a listing of which wrappers support |rename|. 4.3.3 |rename| may now be
able to rename files across partitions on *nix based systems, provided the
appropriate permissions are held. Warnings may be generated if the destination
filesystem doesn't permit chown() or chmod() system calls to be made on files
&mdash; for example, if the destination filesystem is a FAT filesystem.
