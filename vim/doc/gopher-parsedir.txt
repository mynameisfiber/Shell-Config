*gopher_parsedir* -- Translate a gopher formatted directory entry into an
associative array.

  array gopher_parsedir(string dirent)~

|gopher_parsedir| parses a gopher formatted directory entry into an
associative array.

While gopher returns text/plain documents for actual document requests. A
request to a directory (such as /) will return specially encoded series of
lines with each line being one directory entry or information line.

{dirent} The directory entry.

Returns an associative array whose components are: type - One of the
GOPHER_XXX constants.

title - The name of the resource.

path - The path of the resource.

host - The domain name of the host that has this document (or directory).

port - The port at which to connect on host.

Upon failure, the additional data entry of the returned array will hold the
parsed line.

In the example above, the root directory at gopher.example.com knows about one
DOCUMENT identified by 0 located at
gopher://gopher.example.com:70/allabout.txt. It also knows about two other
directory (which have their own listing files) at
gopher://gopher.exmaple.com:70/stories and at
gopher://gopher.ejemplo.co.es:70/. In addition there is a binary file, a link
to an HTTP url, and several informative lines.

By passing each line of the directory listing into |gopher_parsedir|, an
associative array is formed containing a parsed out version of the data.

Using |gopher_parsedir|

<?php >
  $directory = file("gopher://gopher.example.com");
  
  foreach($directory as $dirent) {
      print_r(gopher_parsedir($dirent));
  }
?>

The above example will output:

  Array (
    [type] => 0
    [title] => All about my gopher site.
    [path] => /allabout.txt
    [host] => gopher.example.com
    [port] => 70
  )
  Array (
    [type] => 9
