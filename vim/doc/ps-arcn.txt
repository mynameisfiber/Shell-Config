  bool ps_arcn(resource psdoc, float x, float y, float radius, float alpha, float beta)~

Draws a portion of a circle with at middle point at ({x}, {y}). The arc starts
at an angle of {alpha} and ends at an angle of {beta}. It is drawn clockwise
(use |ps_arc| to draw counterclockwise). The subpath added to the current path
starts on the arc at angle {beta} and ends on the arc at angle {alpha}.

{psdoc} Resource identifier of the postscript file as returned by |ps_new|.

{x} The x-coordinate of the circle's middle point.

{y} The y-coordinate of the circle's middle point.

{radius} The radius of the circle

{alpha} The starting angle given in degrees.

{beta} The end angle given in degrees.
