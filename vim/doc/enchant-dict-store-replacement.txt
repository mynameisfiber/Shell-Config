*enchant_dict_store_replacement* -- Add a correction for a word

  void enchant_dict_store_replacement(resource dict, string mis, string cor)~

Add a correction for 'mis' using 'cor'. Notes that you replaced @mis with
@cor, so it's possibly more likely that future occurrences of @mis will be
replaced with @cor. So it might bump @cor up in the suggestion list.

{dict} Dictionary resource

{mis} The work to fix

{cor} The correct word

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.
