*main* -- Dummy for main

There is no function named |main| except in the PHP source. In PHP 4.3.0, a
new type of error handling in the PHP source (php_error_docref) was
introduced. One feature is to provide links to a manual page in PHP error
messages when the PHP directives html_errors (on by default) and docref_root
(on by default until PHP 4.3.2) are set.

Sometimes error messages refer to a manual page for the function |main| which
is why this page exists. If you discover such a reference, please file a bug
report, indicating the PHP function caused the error that linked to |main| and
it will be fixed and properly documented.

Known errors that point to |main| Function name No longer points here as of
|include| 5.1.0 |include_once| 5.1.0 |require| 5.1.0 |require_once| 5.1.0
