*imagetruecolortopalette* -- Convert a true color image to a palette image

  bool imagetruecolortopalette(resource image, bool dither, int ncolors)~

|imagetruecolortopalette| converts a truecolor image to a palette image. The
code for this function was originally drawn from the Independent JPEG Group
library code, which is excellent. The code has been modified to preserve as
much alpha channel information as possible in the resulting palette, in
addition to preserving colors as well as possible. This does not work as well
as might be hoped. It is usually best to simply produce a truecolor output
image instead, which guarantees the highest output quality.

{ image}An image resource, returned by one of the image creation functions,
such as |imagecreatetruecolor|.

{dither} Indicates if the image should be dithered - if it is TRUE then
dithering will be used which will result in a more speckled image but with
better color approximation.

{ncolors} Sets the maximum number of colors that should be retained in the
palette.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

Converting a true color image to a palette-based image

<?php >
  // Create a new true color image
  $im = imagecreatetruecolor(100, 100);
  
  // Convert to palette-based with no dithering and 255 colors
  imagetruecolortopalette($im, false, 255);
  
  // Save the image
  imagepng($im, './paletteimage.png');
  imagedestroy($im);
?>





This function requires GD 2.0.1 or later (2.0.28 or later is recommended).
