*touch* -- Sets access and modification time of file

  bool touch(string filename [, int time [, int atime]])~

Attempts to set the access and modification times of the file named in the
{filename} parameter to the value given in {time}. Note that the access time
is always modified, regardless of the number of parameters.

If the file does not exist, it will be created.

{filename} The name of the file being touched.

{time} The touch time. If {time} is not supplied, the current system time is
used.

{atime} If present, the access time of the given filename is set to the value
of {atime}. Otherwise, it is set to {time}.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

Version Description 5.3.0 It became possible to change the modification time
of a directory under Windows.

|touch| example

<?php >
  if (touch($filename)) {
      echo $filename . ' modification time has been changed to present time';
  } else {
      echo 'Sorry, could not change modification time of ' . $filename;
  }
?>





|touch| using the {time} parameter

<?php >
  // This is the touch time, we'll set it to one hour in the past.
  $time = time() - 3600;
  
  // Touch the file
  if (!touch('some_file.txt', $time)) {
      echo 'Whoops, something went wrong...';
  } else {
      echo 'Touched file with success';
  }
?>





Note that time resolution may differ from one file system to another.

Prior to PHP 5.3.0 it was not possible to change the modification time of a
directory with this function under Windows.
