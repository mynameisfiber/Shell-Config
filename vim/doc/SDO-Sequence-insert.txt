  void SDO_Sequence::insert(mixed value [, int sequenceIndex [, mixed propertyIdentifier]])~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

Insert a new element at a specified position in the sequence. All subsequent
sequence items are moved up.

{value} The new value to be inserted. This can be either a primitive or an
SDO_DataObject.

{sequenceIndex} The position at which to insert the new element. Default is
NULL, which results in the new value being appended to the sequence.

{propertyIdentifier} Either a property index, a property name, or an
SDO_Model_Property, used to identify a property in the sequence's
corresponding SDO_DataObject. A value of NULL signifies unstructured text.

None.

{SDO_IndexOutOfBoundsException} Thrown if the sequence index is less than zero
or greater than the size of the sequence.

{SDO_InvalidConversionException} Thrown if the type of the new value cannot be
juggled to match the type for the specified data object property.
