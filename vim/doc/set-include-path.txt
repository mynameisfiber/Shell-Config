|set_include_path| example

  // Works as of PHP 4.3.0

Adding to the include path Making use of the PATH_SEPARATOR constant, it is
possible to extend the include path regardless of the operating system.

In this example we add /usr/lib/pear to the end of the existing include_path.

<?php >
  $path = '/usr/lib/pear';
  set_include_path(get_include_path() . PATH_SEPARATOR . $path);
?>
