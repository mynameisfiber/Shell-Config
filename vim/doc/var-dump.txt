*var_dump* -- Dumps information about a variable

  void var_dump(mixed expression [, mixed expression [, mixed ...]])~

This function displays structured information about one or more expressions
that includes its type and value. Arrays and objects are explored recursively
with values indented to show structure.

In PHP 5 all public, private and protected properties of objects will be
returned in the output.

As with anything that outputs its result directly to the browser, the
output-control functions can be used to capture the output of this function,
and save it in a string (for example).

{expression} The variable you want to export.

No value is returned.
