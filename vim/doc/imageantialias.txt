*imageantialias* -- Should antialias functions be used or not

  bool imageantialias(resource image, bool enabled)~

Activate the fast drawing antialiased methods for lines and wired polygons. It
does not support alpha components. It works using a direct blend operation. It
works only with truecolor images.

Thickness and styled are not supported.

Using antialiased primitives with transparent background color can end with
some unexpected results. The blend method uses the background color as any
other colors. The lack of alpha component support does not allow an alpha
based antialiasing method.

{ image}An image resource, returned by one of the image creation functions,
such as |imagecreatetruecolor|.

{enabled} Whether to enable antialiasing or not.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

A comparison of two lines, one with anti-aliasing switched on

<?php >
  // Setup an anti-aliased image and a normal image
  $aa = imagecreatetruecolor(400, 100);
  $normal = imagecreatetruecolor(200, 100);
  
  // Switch antialiasing on for one image
  imageantialias($aa, true);
  
  // Allocate colors
  $red = imagecolorallocate($normal, 255, 0, 0);
  $red_aa = imagecolorallocate($aa, 255, 0, 0);
  
  // Draw two lines, one with AA enabled
  imageline($normal, 0, 0, 200, 100, $red);
  imageline($aa, 0, 0, 200, 100, $red_aa);
  
  // Merge the two images side by side for output (AA: left, Normal: Right)
  imagecopymerge($aa, $normal, 200, 0, 0, 0, 200, 100, 100);
  
  // Output image
  header('Content-type: image/png');
  
  imagepng($aa);
  imagedestroy($aa);
  imagedestroy($normal);
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

Output of example : A comparison of two lines, one with anti-aliasing switched
on
