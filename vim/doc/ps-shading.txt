*ps_shading* -- Creates a shading for later use

  int ps_shading(resource psdoc, string type, float x0, float y0, float x1, float y1, float c1, float c2, float c3, float c4, string optlist)~

Creates a shading, which can be used by |ps_shfill| or |ps_shading_pattern|.

The color of the shading can be in any color space except for pattern.

{psdoc} Resource identifier of the postscript file as returned by |ps_new|.

{type} The type of shading can be either radial or axial. Each shading starts
with the current fill color and ends with the given color values passed in the
parameters {c1} to {c4} (see |ps_setcolor| for their meaning).

{x0, x1, y0, y1} The coordinates {x0}, {y0}, {x1}, {y1} are the start and end
point of the shading. If the type of shading is radial the two points are the
middle points of a starting and ending circle.

{c1, c2, c3, c4} See |ps_setcolor| for their meaning.

{optlist} If the shading is of type radial the {optlist} must also contain the
parameters r0 and r1 with the radius of the start and end circle.

Returns the identifier of the pattern or FALSE on failure.
