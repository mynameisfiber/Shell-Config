*variant_int* -- Returns the integer portion of a variant

  mixed variant_int(mixed variant)~

Gets the integer portion of a variant.

{variant} The variant.

As with all the variant arithmetic functions, the parameters for this function
can be either a PHP native type (integer, string, floating point, boolean or
NULL), or an instance of a COM, VARIANT or DOTNET class. PHP native types will
be converted to variants using the same rules as found in the constructor for
the class. COM and DOTNET objects will have the value of their default
property taken and used as the variant value.

The variant arithmetic functions are wrappers around the similarly named
functions in the COM library; for more information on these functions, consult
the MSDN library. The PHP functions are named slightly differently; for
example |variant_add| in PHP corresponds to VarAdd() in the MSDN
documentation.

If {variant} is negative, then the first negative integer greater than or
equal to the variant is returned, otherwise returns the integer portion of the
value of {variant}.

|variant_fix| |variant_round| |floor| |ceil| |round|
