*mcrypt_decrypt* -- Decrypts crypttext with given parameters

  string mcrypt_decrypt(string cipher, string key, string data, string mode [, string iv])~

Decrypts the {data} and returns the unencrypted data.

{cipher} One of the MCRYPT_ciphername constants, or the name of the algorithm
as string.

{key} The key with which the data was encrypted. If it's smaller than the
required keysize, it is padded with '\0'.

{data} The data that will be decrypted with the given {cipher} and {mode}. If
the size of the data is not n * blocksize, the data will be padded with '\0'.

{mode} One of the MCRYPT_MODE_modename constants, or one of the following
strings: "ecb", "cbc", "cfb", "ofb", "nofb" or "stream".

{iv} The {iv} parameter is used for the initialization in CBC, CFB, OFB modes,
and in some algorithms in STREAM mode. If you do not supply an IV, while it is
needed for an algorithm, the function issues a warning and uses an IV with all
its bytes set to '\0'.

Returns the decrypted data as a string.
