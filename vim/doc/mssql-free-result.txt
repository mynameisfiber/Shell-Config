result identifier as an argument and the associated result memory will be
freed.

{result} The result resource that is being freed. This result comes from a
call to |mssql_query|.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

|mssql_free_result| example

<?php >
  // Select some data from a table
  $query = mssql_query('SELECT * FROM [php].[dbo].[persons]', $link);
  
  // Handle query result here
  
  // When we're done we free the result by calling
  // mssql_free_result like so:
  mssql_free_result($query);
?>
