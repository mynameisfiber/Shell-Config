*virtual* -- Perform an Apache sub-request

  bool virtual(string filename)~

|virtual| is an Apache-specific function which is similar to in mod_include.
It performs an Apache sub-request. It is useful for including CGI scripts or
.shtml files, or anything else that you would parse through Apache. Note that
for a CGI script, the script must generate valid CGI headers. At the minimum
that means it must generate a Content-Type header.

To run the sub-request, all buffers are terminated and flushed to the browser,
pending headers are sent too.

This function is only supported when PHP is installed as an Apache module.

{filename} The file that the virtual command will be performed on.

Performs the virtual command on success, or returns FALSE on failure.

Version Description 4.0.6 This function may be used on PHP files. However, it
is typically better to use |include| or |require| for PHP files.

See |apache_note| for an example.

The query string can be passed to the included file but $_GET is copied from
the parent script and only $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] is filled with the passed
query string. The query string may only be passed when using Apache 2. The
requested file will not be listed in the Apache access log.

Environment variables set in the requested file are not visible to the calling
script.

As of PHP 4.3.3 you can use this function with the NSAPI server module in
Netscape/iPlanet/SunONE webservers, too.
