*mysql_select_db* -- Select a MySQL database

  bool mysql_select_db(string database_name [, resource link_identifier])~

Sets the current active database on the server that's associated with the
specified link identifier. Every subsequent call to |mysql_query| will be made
on the active database.

{database_name} The name of the database that is to be selected.

{ link_identifier}The MySQL connection. If the link identifier is not
specified, the last link opened by |mysql_connect| is assumed. If no such link
is found, it will try to create one as if |mysql_connect| was called with no
arguments. If no connection is found or established, an E_WARNING level error
is generated.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

<?php >
  $link = mysql_connect('localhost', 'mysql_user', 'mysql_password');
  if (!$link) {
      die('Not connected : ' . mysql_error());

  // make foo the current db
  $db_selected = mysql_select_db('foo', $link);
  if (!$db_selected) {
      die ('Can\'t use foo : ' . mysql_error());
  }
