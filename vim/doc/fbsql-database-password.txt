*fbsql_database_password* -- Sets or retrieves the password for a FrontBase
database

  string fbsql_database_password(resource link_identifier [, string database_password])~

Sets and retrieves the database password used by the connection. If a database
is protected by a database password, the user must call this function before
calling |fbsql_select_db|.

If no link is open, the function will try to establish a link as if
|fbsql_connect| was called, and use it.

This function does not change the database password in the database nor can it
be used to retrieve the database password for a database.

{ link_identifier}A FrontBase link identifier returned by |fbsql_connect| or
|fbsql_pconnect|.

If optional and not specified, the function will try to find an open link to
the FrontBase server and if no such link is found it will try to create one as
if |fbsql_connect| was called with no arguments.

{database_password} The database password, as a string. If given, the function
sets the database password for the specified link identifier.

Returns the database password associated with the link identifier.

|fbsql_create_clob| example

<?php >
  $link = fbsql_pconnect("localhost", "_SYSTEM", "secret")
      or die("Could not connect");
  fbsql_database_password($link, "secret db password");
  fbsql_select_db($database, $link);
?>
