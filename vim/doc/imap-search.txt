*imap_search* -- This function returns an array of messages matching the given
search criteria

  array imap_search(resource imap_stream, string criteria [, int options [, string charset]])~

This function performs a search on the mailbox currently opened in the given
IMAP stream.

For example, to match all unanswered messages sent by Mom, you'd use:
"UNANSWERED FROM mom". Searches appear to be case insensitive. This list of
criteria is from a reading of the UW c-client source code and may be
incomplete or inaccurate (see also RFC2060, section 6.4.4).
