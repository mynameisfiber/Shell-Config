*mcrypt_create_iv* -- Creates an initialization vector (IV) from a random source

  string mcrypt_create_iv(int size [, int source])~

Creates an initialization vector (IV) from a random source.

The IV is only meant to give an alternative seed to the encryption routines.
This IV does not need to be secret at all, though it can be desirable. You
even can send it along with your ciphertext without losing security.

{size} The size of the IV.

{source} The source of the IV. The source can be MCRYPT_RAND (system random
number generator), MCRYPT_DEV_RANDOM (read data from /dev/random) and
MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM (read data from /dev/urandom). Prior to 5.3.0, MCRYPT_RAND
was the only one supported on Windows.

Returns the initialization vector, or FALSE on error.

Version Description 5.3.0 MCRYPT_DEV_RANDOM and MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM became
available on Windows platforms. 5.3.0 It is no longer required to call |srand|
first. This is now done automatically.

|mcrypt_create_iv| Example

<?php >
      $size = mcrypt_get_iv_size(MCRYPT_CAST_256, MCRYPT_MODE_CFB);
      $iv = mcrypt_create_iv($size, MCRYPT_DEV_RANDOM);
?>
