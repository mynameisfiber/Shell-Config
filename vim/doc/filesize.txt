*filesize* -- Gets file size

  int filesize(string filename)~

Gets the size for the given file.

{filename} Path to the file.

Returns the size of the file in bytes, or FALSE (and generates an error of
level E_WARNING) in case of an error.

Because PHP's integer type is signed and many platforms use 32bit integers,
|filesize| may return unexpected results for files which are larger than 2GB.
For files between 2GB and 4GB in size this can usually be overcome by using
sprintf("%u", filesize($file)).

|filesize| example

<?php >
  // outputs e.g.  somefile.txt: 1024 bytes
  
  $filename = 'somefile.txt';
  echo $filename . ': ' . filesize($filename) . ' bytes';
?>





Upon failure, an E_WARNING is emitted.

The results of this function are cached. See |clearstatcache| for more
details.

As of PHP 5.0.0, this function can also be used with some URL wrappers. Refer
to for a listing of which wrappers support |stat| family of functionality.
