*ps_delete* -- Deletes all resources of a PostScript document

  bool ps_delete(resource psdoc)~

Mainly frees memory used by the document. Also closes a file, if it was not
closed before with |ps_close|. You should in any case close the file with
|ps_close| before, because |ps_close| not just closes the file but also
outputs a trailor containing PostScript comments like the number of pages in
the document and adding the bookmark hierarchy.

{psdoc} Resource identifier of the postscript file as returned by |ps_new|.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

|ps_close|
