*pg_field_type* -- Returns the type name for the corresponding field number

  string pg_field_type(resource result, int field_number)~

|pg_field_type| returns a string containing the base type name of the given
{field_number} in the given PostgreSQL {result} resource.

If the field uses a PostgreSQL domain (rather than a basic type), it is the
name of the domain's underlying type that is returned, rather than the name of
the domain itself.

This function used to be called |pg_fieldtype|.

{result} PostgreSQL query result resource, returned by |pg_query|,
|pg_query_params| or |pg_execute| (among others).

{field_number} Field number, starting from 0.

A string containing the base name of the field's type, or FALSE on error.

Getting information about fields

<?php >
    $dbconn = pg_connect("dbname=publisher") or die("Could not connect");
  
    // Assume 'title' is a varchar type
    $res = pg_query($dbconn, "select title from authors where author = 'Orwell'");
  
    echo "Title field type: ", pg_field_type($res, 0);
?>

The above example will output:

  Title field type: varchar
