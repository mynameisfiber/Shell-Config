*get_included_files* -- Returns an array with the names of included or required
files

  array get_included_files()~

Gets the names of all files that have been included using |include|,
|include_once|, |require| or |require_once|.

Returns an array of the names of all files.

The script originally called is considered an "included file," so it will be
listed together with the files referenced by |include| and family.

Files that are included or required multiple times only show up once in the
returned array.

Version Description 4.0.1 In PHP 4.0.1 and previous versions this function
assumed that the required files ended in the extension .php; other extensions
would not be returned. The array returned by |get_included_files| was an
associative array and only listed files included by |include| and
|include_once|.

|get_included_files| example

<?php >
  // This file is abc.php
  
  include 'test1.php';
  include_once 'test2.php';
  require 'test3.php';
  require_once 'test4.php';
  
  $included_files = get_included_files();
  
  foreach ($included_files as $filename) {
      echo "$filename\n";
  }
?>

The above example will output:

  abc.php
  test1.php
  test2.php
  test3.php
  test4.php



Files included using the auto_prepend_file configuration directive are not
included in the returned array.
