*hw_GetRemote* -- Gets a remote document

  int hw_getremote(int connection, int objectID)~

Gets a remote document.

Remote documents in Hyperwave notation are documents retrieved from an
external source. Common remote documents are for example external web pages or
queries in a database.

In order to be able to access external sources through remote documents
Hyperwave introduces the HGI (Hyperwave Gateway Interface) which is similar to
the CGI. Currently, only ftp, http-servers and some databases can be accessed
by the HGI.

Calling |hw_getremote| returns the document from the external source. If you
want to use this function you should be very familiar with HGIs. You should
also consider to use PHP instead of Hyperwave to access external sources.
Adding database support by a Hyperwave gateway should be more difficult than
doing it in PHP.

{connection} The connection identifier.

{objectID} The object identifier.

Returns a remote document.
