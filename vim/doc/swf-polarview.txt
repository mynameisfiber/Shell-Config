*swf_polarview* -- Define the viewer's position with polar coordinates

  void swf_polarview(float dist, float azimuth, float incidence, float twist)~

The |swf_polarview| function defines the viewer's position in polar
coordinates.

{dist} The distance between the viewpoint to the world space origin.

{azimuth} Defines the azimuthal angle in the x,y coordinate plane, measured in
distance from the y axis.

{incidence} Defines the angle of incidence in the y,z plane, measured in
distance from the z axis. The incidence angle is defined as the angle of the
viewport relative to the z axis.

{twist} Specifies the amount that the viewpoint is to be rotated about the
line of sight using the right hand rule.

No value is returned.
