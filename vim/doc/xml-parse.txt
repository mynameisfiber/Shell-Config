*xml_parse* -- Start parsing an XML document

  int xml_parse(resource parser, string data [, bool is_final])~

|xml_parse| parses an XML document. The handlers for the configured events are
called as many times as necessary.

{parser} A reference to the XML parser to use.

{data} Chunk of data to parse. A document may be parsed piece-wise by calling
|xml_parse| several times with new data, as long as the {is_final} parameter
is set and TRUE when the last data is parsed.

{is_final} If set and TRUE, {data} is the last piece of data sent in this
parse.

Returns 1 on success or 0 on failure.

For unsuccessful parses, error information can be retrieved with
|xml_get_error_code|, |xml_error_string|, |xml_get_current_line_number|,
|xml_get_current_column_number| and |xml_get_current_byte_index|.

Entity errors are reported at the end of the data thus only if {is_final} is
set and TRUE.
