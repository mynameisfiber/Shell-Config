*pg_transaction_status* -- Returns the current in-transaction status of the
server.

  int pg_transaction_status(resource connection)~

Returns the current in-transaction status of the server.

|pg_transaction_status| will give incorrect results when using a PostgreSQL
7.3 server that has the parameter autocommit set to off. The server-side
autocommit feature has been deprecated and does not exist in later server
versions.

{connection} PostgreSQL database connection resource.

The status can be PGSQL_TRANSACTION_IDLE (currently idle),
PGSQL_TRANSACTION_ACTIVE (a command is in progress), PGSQL_TRANSACTION_INTRANS
(idle, in a valid transaction block), or PGSQL_TRANSACTION_INERROR (idle, in a
failed transaction block). PGSQL_TRANSACTION_UNKNOWN is reported if the
connection is bad. PGSQL_TRANSACTION_ACTIVE is reported only when a query has
been sent to the server and not yet completed.

|pg_transaction_status| example

<?php >
    $dbconn = pg_connect("dbname=publisher") or die("Could not connect");
    $stat = pg_transaction_status($dbconn);
    if ($stat === PGSQL_TRANSACTION_UNKNOWN) {
        echo 'Connection is bad';
    } else if ($stat === PGSQL_TRANSACTION_IDLE) {
        echo 'Connection is currently idle';
    } else {
        echo 'Connection is in a transaction state';
    }    
?>
