*yaz_connect* -- Prepares for a connection to a Z39.50 server

  mixed yaz_connect(string zurl [, mixed options])~

This function returns a connection resource on success, zero on failure.

|yaz_connect| prepares for a connection to a Z39.50 server. This function is
non-blocking and does not attempt to establish a connection - it merely
prepares a connect to be performed later when |yaz_wait| is called.

The YAZ proxy is a freely available Z39.50 proxy.

{zurl} A string that takes the form host[:port][/database]. If port is
omitted, port 210 is used. If database is omitted Default is used.

{options} If given as a string, it is treated as the Z39.50 V2 authentication
string (OpenAuth).

If given as an array, the contents of the array serves as options. user
Username for authentication.

group Group for authentication.

password Password for authentication.

cookie Cookie for session (YAZ proxy).

proxy Proxy for connection (YAZ proxy).

persistent A boolean. If TRUE the connection is persistent; If FALSE the
connection is not persistent. By default connections are persistent.

If you open a persistent connection, you won't be able to close it later with
|yaz_close|.

piggyback A boolean. If TRUE piggyback is enabled for searches; If FALSE
piggyback is disabled. By default piggyback is enabled.

Enabling piggyback is more efficient and usually saves a network-round-trip
for first time fetches of records. However, a few Z39.50 servers do not
support piggyback or they ignore element set names. For those, piggyback
should be disabled.

charset A string that specifies character set to be used in Z39.50 language
and character set negotiation. Use strings such as: ISO-8859-1, UTF-8, UTF-16.

Most Z39.50 servers do not support this feature (and thus, this is ignored).
Many servers use the ISO-8859-1 encoding for queries and messages.
MARC21/USMARC records are not affected by this setting.

preferredMessageSize An integer that specifies the maximum byte size of all
records to be returned by a target during retrieval. See the Z39.50 standard
for more information.

This option is supported in PECL YAZ 1.0.5 or later.

maximumRecordSize An integer that specifies the maximum byte size of a single
record to be returned by a target during retrieval. This entity is referred to
as Exceptional-record-size in the Z39.50 standard.

This option is supported in PECL YAZ 1.0.5 or later.

A connection resource on success, FALSE on error.

Version Description 4.1.0 The parameter {options} was added.
