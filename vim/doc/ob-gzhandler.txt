*ob_gzhandler* -- ob_start callback function to gzip output buffer

  string ob_gzhandler(string buffer, int mode)~

|ob_gzhandler| is intended to be used as a callback function for |ob_start| to
help facilitate sending gz-encoded data to web browsers that support
compressed web pages. Before |ob_gzhandler| actually sends compressed data, it
determines what type of content encoding the browser will accept ("gzip",
"deflate" or none at all) and will return its output accordingly. All browsers
are supported since it's up to the browser to send the correct header saying
that it accepts compressed web pages. If a browser doesn't support compressed
pages this function returns FALSE.

{buffer}

{mode}



Version Description 4.0.5 The {mode} parameter was added.

|ob_gzhandler| example

<?php >
  ob_start("ob_gzhandler");
?>
  <html>
  <body>
  <p>This should be a compressed page.</p>
  </html>
  <body>





|ob_gzhandler| requires the zlib extension.

You cannot use both |ob_gzhandler| and zlib.output_compression. Also note that
using zlib.output_compression is preferred over |ob_gzhandler|.

|ob_start| |ob_end_flush|
