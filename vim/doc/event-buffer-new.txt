*event_buffer_new* -- Create new buffered event

  resource event_buffer_new(resource stream, mixed readcb, mixed writecb, mixed errorcb [, mixed arg])~

Libevent provides an abstraction layer on top of the regular event API. Using
buffered event you don't need to deal with the I/O manually, instead it
provides input and output buffers that get filled and drained automatically.

{stream} Valid PHP stream resource. Must be castable to file descriptor.

{readcb} Callback to invoke where there is data to read, or NULL if no
callback is desired.

{writecb} Callback to invoke where the descriptor is ready for writing, or
NULL if no callback is desired.

{errorcb} Callback to invoke where there is an error on the descriptor, cannot
be NULL.

{arg} An argument that will be passed to each of the callbacks (optional).

|event_buffer_new| returns new buffered event resource on success or FALSE on
error.
