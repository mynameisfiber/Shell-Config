  bool ncurses_slk_init(int format)~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

Initializes soft label key functions

This function must be called before |ncurses_init| or |ncurses_newwin| is
called.

{format} If |ncurses_init| eventually uses a line from stdscr to emulate the
soft labels, then this parameter determines how the labels are arranged of the
screen.

0 indicates a 3-2-3 arrangement of the labels, 1 indicates a 4-4 arrangement
and 2 indicates the PC like 4-4-4 mode, but in addition an index line will be
created.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.
