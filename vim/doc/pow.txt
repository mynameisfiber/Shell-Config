*pow* -- Exponential expression

  number pow(number base, number exp)~

Returns {base} raised to the power of {exp}.

In PHP 4.0.6 and earlier |pow| always returned a float, and did not issue
warnings.

{base} The base to use

{exp} The exponent

{base} raised to the power of {exp}. If the result can be represented as
integer it will be returned as type integer, else it will be returned as type
float. If the power cannot be computed FALSE will be returned instead.

Version Description Since 4.0.6 The function will now return integer results
if possible, before this it always returned a float result. For older
versions, you may receive a bogus result for complex numbers. Since 4.2.0 PHP
stops to emit a warning if the value can't be computed, it will now silently
return FALSE only.

Some examples of |pow|

<?php >
  var_dump(pow(2, 8)); // int(256)
  echo pow(-1, 20); // 1
  echo pow(0, 0); // 1
  
  echo pow(-1, 5.5); // PHP >4.0.6  NAN
  echo pow(-1, 5.5); // PHP <=4.0.6 1.#IND
?>
