*strptime* -- Parse a time/date generated with strftime

  array strptime(string date, string format)~

|strptime| returns an array with the {date} parsed, or FALSE on error.

Month and weekday names and other language dependent strings respect the
current locale set with |setlocale| (LC_TIME).

{date} (string) The string to parse (e.g. returned from |strftime|).

{format} (string) The format used in {date} (e.g. the same as used in
|strftime|). Note that some of the format options available to |strftime| may
not have any effect within |strptime|; the exact subset that are supported
will vary based on the operating system and C library in use.

For more information about the format options, read the |strftime| page.

Returns an array or FALSE on failure.

The following parameters are returned in the array parameters Description
"tm_sec" Seconds after the minute (0-61) "tm_min" Minutes after the hour
(0-59) "tm_hour" Hour since midnight (0-23) "tm_mday" Day of the month (1-31)
"tm_mon" Months since January (0-11) "tm_year" Years since 1900 "tm_wday" Days
since Sunday (0-6) "tm_yday" Days since January 1 (0-365) "unparsed" the
{date} part which was not recognized using the specified {format}

|strptime| example

<?php >
  $format = '%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S';
  $strf = strftime($format);
  
  echo "$strf\n";
  
  print_r(strptime($strf, $format));
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  03/10/2004 15:54:19
  
  Array
  (
      [tm_sec] => 19
      [tm_min] => 54
      [tm_hour] => 15
      [tm_mday] => 3
      [tm_mon] => 9
      [tm_year] => 104
      [tm_wday] => 0
      [tm_yday] => 276
      [unparsed] =>
  )



This function is not implemented on Windows platforms.

Internally, this function calls the strptime() function provided by the
system's C library. This function can exhibit noticeably different behaviour
across different operating systems. The use of |date_parse_from_format|, which
does not suffer from these issues, is recommended on PHP 5.3.0 and later.

"tm_sec" includes any leap seconds (currently upto 2 a year). For more
information on leap seconds, see the Wikipedia article on leap seconds.

Prior to PHP 5.2.0, this function could return undefined behaviour. Notably,
the "tm_sec", "tm_min" and "tm_hour" entries would return undefined values.
