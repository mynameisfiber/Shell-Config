*readgzfile* -- Output a gz-file

  int readgzfile(string filename [, int use_include_path])~

Reads a file, decompresses it and writes it to standard output.

|readgzfile| can be used to read a file which is not in gzip format; in this
case |readgzfile| will directly read from the file without decompression.

{filename} The file name. This file will be opened from the filesystem and its
contents written to standard output.

{use_include_path} You can set this optional parameter to 1, if you want to
search for the file in the include_path too.

Returns the number of (uncompressed) bytes read from the file. If an error
occurs, FALSE is returned and unless the function was called as @readgzfile,
an error message is printed.

|gzpassthru| |gzfile| |gzopen|
