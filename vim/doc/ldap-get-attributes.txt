*ldap_get_attributes* -- Get attributes from a search result entry

  array ldap_get_attributes(resource link_identifier, resource result_entry_identifier)~

Reads attributes and values from an entry in the search result.

Having located a specific entry in the directory, you can find out what
information is held for that entry by using this call. You would use this call
for an application which "browses" directory entries and/or where you do not
know the structure of the directory entries. In many applications you will be
searching for a specific attribute such as an email address or a surname, and
won't care what other data is held.

  return_value["count"] = number of attributes in the entry
  return_value[0] = first attribute
  return_value[n] = nth attribute
  
  return_value["attribute"]["count"] = number of values for attribute
  return_value["attribute"][0] = first value of the attribute
  return_value["attribute"][i] = (i+1)th value of the attribute

{link_identifier} An LDAP link identifier, returned by |ldap_connect|.

{result_entry_identifier}

Returns a complete entry information in a multi-dimensional array on success
and FALSE on error.

Show the list of attributes held for a particular directory entry

<?php >
  // $ds is the link identifier for the directory
  
  // $sr is a valid search result from a prior call to
  // one of the ldap directory search calls
  
  $entry = ldap_first_entry($ds, $sr);
  
  $attrs = ldap_get_attributes($ds, $entry);
  
  echo $attrs["count"] . " attributes held for this entry:<p>";
  
  for ($i=0; $i < $attrs["count"]; $i++) {
      echo $attrs[$i] . "<br />";
  }
?>
