*filectime* -- Gets inode change time of file

  int filectime(string filename)~

Gets the inode change time of a file.

{filename} Path to the file.

Returns the time the file was last changed, or FALSE on failure. The time is
returned as a Unix timestamp.

A |filectime| example

<?php >
  // outputs e.g.  somefile.txt was last changed: December 29 2002 22:16:23.
  
  $filename = 'somefile.txt';
  if (file_exists($filename)) {
      echo "$filename was last changed: " . date("F d Y H:i:s.", filectime($filename));
  }
?>





Upon failure, an E_WARNING is emitted.

Note: In most Unix filesystems, a file is considered changed when its inode
data is changed; that is, when the permissions, owner, group, or other
metadata from the inode is updated. See also |filemtime| (which is what you
want to use when you want to create "Last Modified" footers on web pages) and
|fileatime|.

Note also that in some Unix texts the ctime of a file is referred to as being
the creation time of the file. This is wrong. There is no creation time for
Unix files in most Unix filesystems.

Note that time resolution may differ from one file system to another.

The results of this function are cached. See |clearstatcache| for more
details.

As of PHP 5.0.0, this function can also be used with some URL wrappers. Refer
to for a listing of which wrappers support |stat| family of functionality.
