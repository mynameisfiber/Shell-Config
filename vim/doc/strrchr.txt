*strrchr* -- Find the last occurrence of a character in a string

  string strrchr(string haystack, mixed needle)~

This function returns the portion of {haystack} which starts at the last
occurrence of {needle} and goes until the end of {haystack}.

{haystack} The string to search in

{needle} If {needle} contains more than one character, only the first is used.
This behavior is different from that of |strstr|.

If {needle} is not a string, it is converted to an integer and applied as the
ordinal value of a character.

This function returns the portion of string, or FALSE if {needle} is not
found.

Version Description 4.3.0 This function is now binary safe.

  $last = substr(strrchr($text, 10), 1 );
