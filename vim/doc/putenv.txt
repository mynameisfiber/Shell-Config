*putenv* -- Sets the value of an environment variable

  bool putenv(string setting)~

Adds {setting} to the server environment. The environment variable will only
exist for the duration of the current request. At the end of the request the
environment is restored to its original state.

Setting certain environment variables may be a potential security breach. The
safe_mode_allowed_env_vars directive contains a comma-delimited list of
prefixes. In Safe Mode, the user may only alter environment variables whose
names begin with the prefixes supplied by this directive. By default, users
will only be able to set environment variables that begin with PHP_ (e.g.
PHP_FOO=BAR). Note: if this directive is empty, PHP will let the user modify
ANY environment variable!

The safe_mode_protected_env_vars directive contains a comma-delimited list of
environment variables, that the end user won't be able to change using
|putenv|. These variables will be protected even if safe_mode_allowed_env_vars
is set to allow to change them.

{setting} The setting, like "FOO=BAR"

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

Setting an environment variable

<?php >
  putenv("UNIQID=$uniqid");
?>





The safe_mode_allowed_env_vars and safe_mode_protected_env_vars directives
only take effect when safe_mode is enabled.
