*ldap_first_attribute* -- Return first attribute

  string ldap_first_attribute(resource link_identifier, resource result_entry_identifier)~

Gets the first attribute in the given entry. Remaining attributes are
retrieved by calling |ldap_next_attribute| successively.

Similar to reading entries, attributes are also read one by one from a
particular entry.

{link_identifier} An LDAP link identifier, returned by |ldap_connect|.

{result_entry_identifier}

{ber_identifier} {ber_identifier} is the identifier to internal memory
location pointer. It is passed by reference. The same {ber_identifier} is
passed to |ldap_next_attribute| , which modifies that pointer.

This parameter is no longer used as this is now handled automatically by PHP.
For backwards compatibility PHP will not throw an error if this parameter is
passed.

Returns the first attribute in the entry on success and FALSE on error.

Version Description 5.2.4 The {ber_identifier} was removed. This is now
handled automatically by PHP.
