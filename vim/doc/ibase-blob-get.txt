*ibase_blob_get* -- Get len bytes data from open blob

  string ibase_blob_get(resource blob_handle, int len)~

This function returns at most {len} bytes from a BLOB that has been opened for
reading by |ibase_blob_open|.

It is not possible to read from a BLOB that has been opened for writing by
|ibase_blob_create|.

{blob_handle} A BLOB handle opened with |ibase_blob_open|.

{len} Size of returned data.

Returns at most {len} bytes from the BLOB, or FALSE on failure.

|ibase_blob_get| example

<?php >
  $result    = ibase_query("SELECT blob_value FROM table");
  $data      = ibase_fetch_object($result);
  $blob_data = ibase_blob_info($data->BLOB_VALUE);
  $blob_hndl = ibase_blob_open($data->BLOB_VALUE);
  echo         ibase_blob_get($blob_hndl, $blob_data[0]);
?>



Whilst this example doesn't do much more than a
'ibase_blob_echo($data->BLOB_VALUE)' would do, it does show you how to get
information into a $variable to manipulate as you please.
