*ibase_connect* -- Open a connection to an InterBase database

  resource ibase_connect([string database [, string username [, string password [, string charset [, int buffers [, int dialect [, string role [, int sync]]]]]]]])~

Establishes a connection to an InterBase server.

In case a second call is made to |ibase_connect| with the same arguments, no
new link will be established, but instead, the link identifier of the already
opened link will be returned. The link to the server will be closed as soon as
the execution of the script ends, unless it's closed earlier by explicitly
calling |ibase_close|.

{database} The {database} argument has to be a valid path to database file on
the server it resides on. If the server is not local, it must be prefixed with
either 'hostname:' (TCP/IP), '//hostname/' (NetBEUI) or 'hostname@' (IPX/SPX),
depending on the connection protocol used.

{username} The user name. Can be set with the ibase.default_user php.ini
directive.

{password} The password for {username}. Can be set with the
ibase.default_password php.ini directive.

{charset} {charset} is the default character set for a database.

{buffers} {buffers} is the number of database buffers to allocate for the
server-side cache. If 0 or omitted, server chooses its own default.

{dialect} {dialect} selects the default SQL dialect for any statement executed
within a connection, and it defaults to the highest one supported by client
libraries. Functional only with InterBase 6 and up.

{role} Functional only with InterBase 5 and up.

{sync}

Returns an InterBase link identifier on success, or FALSE on error.

If you get some error like "arithmetic exception, numeric overflow, or string
truncation. Cannot transliterate character between character sets" (this
occurs when you try use some character with accents) when using this and after
|ibase_query| you must set the character set (i.e. ISO8859_1 or your current
character set).

|ibase_connect| example

<?php >
  $host = 'localhost:/path/to/your.gdb';
  
  $dbh = ibase_connect($host, $username, $password);
  $stmt = 'SELECT * FROM tblname';
  $sth = ibase_query($dbh, $stmt);
  while ($row = ibase_fetch_object($sth)) {
      echo $row->email, "\n";
  }
  ibase_free_result($sth);
  ibase_close($dbh);
?>
