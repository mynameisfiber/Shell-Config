*stream_set_blocking* -- Set blocking/non-blocking mode on a stream

  bool stream_set_blocking(resource stream, int mode)~

Sets blocking or non-blocking mode on a {stream}.

This function works for any stream that supports non-blocking mode (currently,
regular files and socket streams).

{stream} The stream.

{mode} If {mode} is 0, the given stream will be switched to non-blocking mode,
and if 1, it will be switched to blocking mode. This affects calls like
|fgets| and |fread| that read from the stream. In non-blocking mode an |fgets|
call will always return right away while in blocking mode it will wait for
data to become available on the stream.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

Version Description 4.3.0 Prior to PHP 4.3.0, this function only worked on
socket based streams.

This function was previously called as |set_socket_blocking| and later
|socket_set_blocking| but this usage is deprecated.
