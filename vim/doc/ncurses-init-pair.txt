*ncurses_init_pair* -- Define a color pair

  int ncurses_init_pair(int pair, int fg, int bg)~

Defines or redefines the given color pair to have the given foreground and
background colors. If the color pair was previously initialized, the screen is
refreshed and all occurrences of it are changed to reflect the new definition.

Color capabilities must be initialized using |ncurses_start_color| before
calling this function. The first color pair (color pair 0) is assumed to be
white on black by default, but can be changed using
|ncurses_assume_default_colors|.

{pair} The number of the color pair to define.

{fg} The foreground color for the color pair. May be one of the pre-defined
colors or one defined by |ncurses_init_color| if the terminal has color
changing capabilities.

{bg} The background color for the color pair. May be one of the pre-defined
colors or one defined by |ncurses_init_color| if the terminal has color
changing capabilities.

Returns -1 if the function was successful, and 0 if ncurses or color support
were not initialized.

Note that color changing capabilities are not required for defining color
pairs of pre-existing colors, but only for changing definitions (red, green,
and blue components) of colors themselves per |ncurses_init_color|.

Writing a string with a specified color to the screen

<?php >
  ncurses_init();
  
  // If the terminal supports colors, initialize and set active color
  if (ncurses_has_colors()) {
      ncurses_start_color();
      ncurses_init_pair(1, NCURSES_COLOR_YELLOW, NCURSES_COLOR_BLUE);
      ncurses_color_set(1);
  }
  
  // Write a string at specified location
  ncurses_mvaddstr(10, 10, "Hello world! Yellow on blue text!");
  
  // Flush output to screen
  ncurses_refresh();
  
  ncurses_end();
?>
