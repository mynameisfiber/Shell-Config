*array_merge_recursive* -- Merge two or more arrays recursively

  array array_merge_recursive(array array1 [, array ...])~

|array_merge_recursive| merges the elements of one or more arrays together so
that the values of one are appended to the end of the previous one. It returns
the resulting array.

If the input arrays have the same string keys, then the values for these keys
are merged together into an array, and this is done recursively, so that if
one of the values is an array itself, the function will merge it with a
corresponding entry in another array too. If, however, the arrays have the
same numeric key, the later value will not overwrite the original value, but
will be appended.

{array1} Initial array to merge.

{...} Variable list of arrays to recursively merge.

An array of values resulted from merging the arguments together.

|array_merge_recursive| example

<?php >
  $ar1 = array("color" => array("favorite" => "red"), 5);
  $ar2 = array(10, "color" => array("favorite" => "green", "blue"));
  $result = array_merge_recursive($ar1, $ar2);
  print_r($result);
?>

The above example will output:

  Array
  (
      [color] => Array
          (
              [favorite] => Array
                  (
                      [0] => red
                      [1] => green
                  )
  
              [0] => blue
          )
  
      [0] => 5
      [1] => 10
  )
