*OCI-Lob->flush* -- Flushes/writes buffer of the LOB to the server

  bool flush([int flag])~

|OCI-Lob->flush| actually writes data to the server.

{flag} By default, resources are not freed, but using flag OCI_LOB_BUFFER_FREE
you can do it explicitly. Be sure you know what you're doing - next read/write
operation to the same part of LOB will involve a round-trip to the server and
initialize new buffer resources. It is recommended to use OCI_LOB_BUFFER_FREE
flag only when you are not going to work with the LOB anymore.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

Returns FALSE if buffering was not enabled or an error occurred.
