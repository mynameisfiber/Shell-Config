*ibase_execute* -- Execute a previously prepared query

  resource ibase_execute(resource query [, mixed bind_arg [, mixed ...]])~

Execute a query prepared by |ibase_prepare|.

This is a lot more effective than using |ibase_query| if you are repeating a
same kind of query several times with only some parameters changing.

{query} An InterBase query prepared by |ibase_prepare|.

{bind_arg}

{...}

If the query raises an error, returns FALSE. If it is successful and there is
a (possibly empty) result set (such as with a SELECT query), returns a result
identifier. If the query was successful and there were no results, returns
TRUE.

In PHP 5.0.0 and up, this function returns the number of rows affected by the
query (if > 0 and applicable to the statement type). A query that succeeded,
but did not affect any rows (e.g. an UPDATE of a non-existent record) will
return TRUE.

|ibase_execute| example

<?php >
  $dbh = ibase_connect($host, $username, $password);
  
  $updates = array(
      1 => 'Eric',
      5 => 'Filip',
      7 => 'Larry'
  );
  
  $query = ibase_prepare($dbh, "UPDATE FOO SET BAR = ? WHERE BAZ = ?");
  
  foreach ($updates as $baz => $bar) {
      ibase_execute($query, $bar, $baz);
  }
?>
