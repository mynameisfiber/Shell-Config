*sybase_fetch_assoc* -- Fetch a result row as an associative array

  array sybase_fetch_assoc(resource result)~

|sybase_fetch_assoc| is a version of |sybase_fetch_row| that uses column names
instead of integers for indices in the result array. Columns from different
tables with the same names are returned as name, name1, name2, ..., nameN.

An important thing to note is that using |sybase_fetch_assoc| is NOT
significantly slower than using |sybase_fetch_row|, while it provides a
significant added value.

{result}

Returns an array that corresponds to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are no
more rows.

This function is only available when using the CT library interface to Sybase,
and not with the DB library.
