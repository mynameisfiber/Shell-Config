*mysql_escape_string* -- Escapes a string for use in a mysql_query

  string mysql_escape_string(string unescaped_string)~

This function will escape the {unescaped_string}, so that it is safe to place
it in a |mysql_query|. This function is deprecated.

This function is identical to |mysql_real_escape_string| except that
|mysql_real_escape_string| takes a connection handler and escapes the string
according to the current character set. |mysql_escape_string| does not take a
connection argument and does not respect the current charset setting.

This function has been DEPRECATED as of PHP 5.3.0. Relying on this feature is
highly discouraged.

{unescaped_string} The string that is to be escaped.

Returns the escaped string.

Version Description 5.3.0 This function now throws an E_DEPRECATED notice.
4.3.0 This function became deprecated, do not use this function. Instead, use
|mysql_real_escape_string|.

|mysql_escape_string| example

<?php >
  $item = "Zak's Laptop";
  $escaped_item = mysql_escape_string($item);
  printf("Escaped string: %s\n", $escaped_item);
?>

The above example will output:

  Escaped string: Zak\'s Laptop



|mysql_escape_string| does not escape % and _.

|mysql_real_escape_string| |addslashes| The magic_quotes_gpc directive.
