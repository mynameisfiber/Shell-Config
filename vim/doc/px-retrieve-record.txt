*px_retrieve_record* -- Returns record of paradox database

  array px_retrieve_record(resource pxdoc, int num [, int mode])~

This function is very similar to |px_get_record| but uses internally a
different approach to retrieve the data. It relies on pxlib for reading each
single field value, which usually results in support for more field types.

This function is only available if pxlib >= 0.6.0 is used.

{pxdoc} Resource identifier of the paradox database as returned by |px_new|.

{num} The record number is an artificial number counting records in the order
as they are stored in the database. The first record has number 0.

{mode} The optional {mode} can be PX_KEYTOLOWER or PX_KEYTOUPPER in order to
convert the keys into lower or upper case. If {mode} is not passed or is 0,
then the key will be exactly like the field name. The element values will
contain the field values. NULL values will be retained and are different from
0.0, 0 or the empty string. Fields of type PX_FIELD_TIME will be returned as
an integer counting the number of milliseconds starting at midnight. A
timestamp is a floating point value also counting milliseconds starting at the
beginning of julian calendar.

Returns the {num}"th record from the paradox database. The record is returned
as an associated array with its keys being the field names.
