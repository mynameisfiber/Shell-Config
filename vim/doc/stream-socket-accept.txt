*stream_socket_accept* -- Accept a connection on a socket created by
stream_socket_server

  resource stream_socket_accept(resource server_socket [, float timeout [, string peername]])~

Accept a connection on a socket previously created by |stream_socket_server|.

{server_socket} The server socket to accept a connection from.

{timeout} Override the default socket accept timeout. Time should be given in
seconds.

{peername} Will be set to the name (address) of the client which connected, if
included and available from the selected transport.

Can also be determined later using |stream_socket_get_name|.

Returns a stream to the accepted socket connection or FALSE on failure.

This function should not be used with UDP server sockets. Instead, use
|stream_socket_recvfrom| and |stream_socket_sendto|.
