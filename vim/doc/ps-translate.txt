*ps_translate* -- Sets translation

  bool ps_translate(resource psdoc, float x, float y)~

Sets a new initial point of the coordinate system.

{psdoc} Resource identifier of the postscript file as returned by |ps_new|.

{x} x-coordinate of the origin of the translated coordinate system.

{y} y-coordinate of the origin of the translated coordinate system.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

Translation of the coordinate system

  ps_set_info($ps, "Author", "Uwe Steinmann");
  ps_set_info($ps, "Title", "Translated example");
  ps_set_info($ps, "BoundingBox", "0 0 596 842");
  
  $psfont = ps_findfont($ps, "Helvetica", "", 0);
  
  ps_begin_page($ps, 596, 842);
  ps_set_text_pos($ps, 100, 100);
  ps_translate($ps, 500, 750);
  rectangle($ps);
  ps_translate($ps, -500, -750);
  ps_setfont($ps, $psfont, 8.0);
  ps_show($ps, "Text at initial position");
  ps_end_page($ps);
  
  ps_begin_page($ps, 596, 842);
  ps_set_text_pos($ps, 100, 100);
  ps_save($ps);
  ps_translate($ps, 500, 750);
  rectangle($ps);
  ps_restore($ps);
  ps_setfont($ps, $psfont, 8.0);
  ps_show($ps, "Text at initial position");
  ps_end_page($ps);
  
  ps_delete($ps);
?>

The above example demonstrates two possible ways to place a graphic (in this
case just a rectangle) at any position on the page, while the graphic itself
uses its own coordinate system. The trick is to change the origin of the
current coordinate system before drawing the rectangle. The translation has to
be undone after the graphic has been drawn.

On the second page a slightly different and more elegant approach is applied.
Instead of undoing the translation with a second call of |ps_translate| the
graphics context is saved before modifying the coordinate system and restored
after drawing the rectangle.
