*snmprealwalk* -- Return all objects including their respective object ID within
the specified one

  array snmprealwalk(string host, string community, string object_id [, int timeout [, int retries]])~

The |snmprealwalk| function is used to traverse over a number of SNMP objects
starting from {object_id} and return not only their values but also their
object ids.

{host} The hostname of the SNMP agent (server).

{community} The read community.

{object_id} The SNMP object id which precedes the wanted one.

{timeout} The number of microseconds until the first timeout.

{retries} The number of retries in case timeouts occur.

Returns an associative array of the SNMP object ids and their values on
success or FALSE on error. In case of an error, an E_WARNING message is shown.

Using |snmprealwalk|

<?php >
   print_r(snmprealwalk("localhost", "public", "IF-MIB::ifName"));
?>

The above will output something like: Array ( [IF-MIB::ifName.1] => STRING: lo
[IF-MIB::ifName.2] => STRING: eth0 [IF-MIB::ifName.3] => STRING: eth2
[IF-MIB::ifName.4] => STRING: sit0 [IF-MIB::ifName.5] => STRING: sixxs )
