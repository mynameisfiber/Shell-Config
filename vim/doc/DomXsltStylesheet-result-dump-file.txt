*DomXsltStylesheet->result_dump_file* -- Dumps the result from a
XSLT-Transformation into a file

  string result_dump_file(DomDocument xmldoc, string filename)~

Since always returns a well-formed XML DomDocument, no matter what output
method was declared in <xsl:output> and similar attributes/elements, it's of
not much use, if you want to output HTML 4 or text data.

This function on the contrary honors <xsl:output method="html|text"> and other
output control directives. See the example for instruction on how to use it.

Saving the result of a XSLT transformation in a file

<?php >
  $filename = "stylesheet.xsl";
  $xmldoc = domxml_open_file("data.xml");
  $xsldoc = domxml_xslt_stylesheet_file($filename);
  $result =  $xsldoc->process($xmldoc);
  echo $xsldoc->result_dump_file($result, "filename");     
?>
