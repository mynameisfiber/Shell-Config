*sybase_pconnect* -- Open persistent Sybase connection

  resource sybase_pconnect([string servername [, string username [, string password [, string charset [, string appname]]]]])~

|sybase_pconnect| acts very much like |sybase_connect| with two major
differences.

First, when connecting, the function would first try to find a (persistent)
link that's already open with the same host, username and password. If one is
found, an identifier for it will be returned instead of opening a new
connection.

Second, the connection to the SQL server will not be closed when the execution
of the script ends. Instead, the link will remain open for future use
(|sybase_close| will not close links established by |sybase_pconnect|).

This type of links is therefore called 'persistent'.

{servername} The servername argument has to be a valid servername that is
defined in the 'interfaces' file.

{username} Sybase user name

{password} Password associated with {username}.

{charset} Specifies the charset for the connection

{appname} Specifies an appname for the Sybase connection. This allow you to
make separate connections in the same script to the same database. This may
come handy when you have started a transaction in your current connection, and
you need to be able to do a separate query which cannot be performed inside
this transaction.

Returns a positive Sybase persistent link identifier on success, or FALSE on
error.

Version Description 4.2.0 The {appname} parameter was added. 4.0.2 The
{charset} parameter was added.
