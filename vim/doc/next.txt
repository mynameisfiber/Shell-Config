*next* -- Advance the internal array pointer of an array

  mixed next(array array)~

|next| behaves like |current|, with one difference. It advances the internal
array pointer one place forward before returning the element value. That means
it returns the next array value and advances the internal array pointer by
one.

{array} The array being affected.

Returns the array value in the next place that's pointed to by the internal
array pointer, or FALSE if there are no more elements.

This function may return Boolean FALSE, but may also return a non-Boolean
value which evaluates to FALSE, such as 0 or "". Please read the section on
Booleans for more information. Use the === operator for testing the return
value of this function.

Example use of |next| and friends

<?php >
  $transport = array('foot', 'bike', 'car', 'plane');
  $mode = current($transport); // $mode = 'foot';
  $mode = next($transport);    // $mode = 'bike';
  $mode = next($transport);    // $mode = 'car';
  $mode = prev($transport);    // $mode = 'bike';
  $mode = end($transport);     // $mode = 'plane';
?>





You won't be able to distinguish the end of an array from a boolean FALSE
element. To properly traverse an array which may contain FALSE elements, see
the |each| function.

|current| |end| |prev| |reset| |each|
