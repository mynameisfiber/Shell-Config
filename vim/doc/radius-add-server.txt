*radius_add_server* -- Adds a server

  bool radius_add_server(resource radius_handle, string hostname, int port, string secret, int timeout, int max_tries)~

|radius_add_server| may be called multiple times, and it may be used together
with |radius_config|. At most 10 servers may be specified. When multiple
servers are given, they are tried in round-robin fashion until a valid
response is received, or until each server's {max_tries} limit has been
reached.

{radius_handle}

{hostname} The {hostname} parameter specifies the server host, either as a
fully qualified domain name or as a dotted-quad IP address in text form.

{port} The {port} specifies the UDP port to contact on the server. If port is
given as 0, the library looks up the radius/udp or radacct/udp service in the
network services database, and uses the port found there. If no entry is
found, the library uses the standard Radius ports, 1812 for authentication and
1813 for accounting.

{secret} The shared secret for the server host is passed to the {secret}
parameter. The Radius protocol ignores all but the leading 128 bytes of the
shared secret.

{timeout} The timeout for receiving replies from the server is passed to the
{timeout} parameter, in units of seconds.

{max_tries} The maximum number of repeated requests to make before giving up
is passed into the {max_tries}.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.
