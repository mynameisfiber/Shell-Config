*hw_getremotechildren* -- Gets children of remote document

  mixed hw_getremotechildren(int connection, string object_record)~

Returns the children of a remote document. Children of a remote document are
remote documents itself. This makes sense if a database query has to be
narrowed and is explained in Hyperwave Programmers' Guide.

If you want to use this function you should be very familiar with HGIs. You
should also consider to use PHP instead of Hyperwave to access external
sources. Adding database support by a Hyperwave gateway should be more
difficult than doing it in PHP.

{connection} The connection identifier.

{object_record} The object record.

If the number of children is 1 the function will return the document itself
formatted by the Hyperwave Gateway Interface (HGI). If the number of children
is greater than 1 it will return an array of object record with each maybe the
input value for another call to |hw_getremotechildren|. Those object records
are virtual and do not exist in the Hyperwave server, therefore they do not
have a valid object ID. How exactly such an object record looks like is up to
the HGI.
