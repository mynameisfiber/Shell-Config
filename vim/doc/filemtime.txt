*filemtime* -- Gets file modification time

  int filemtime(string filename)~

This function returns the time when the data blocks of a file were being
written to, that is, the time when the content of the file was changed.

{filename} Path to the file.

Returns the time the file was last modified, or FALSE on failure. The time is
returned as a Unix timestamp, which is suitable for the |date| function.

<?php >
  // outputs e.g.  somefile.txt was last modified: December 29 2002 22:16:23.
  
  $filename = 'somefile.txt';
  if (file_exists($filename)) {
      echo "$filename was last modified: " . date ("F d Y H:i:s.", filemtime($filename));
  }
?>





Upon failure, an E_WARNING is emitted.

Note that time resolution may differ from one file system to another.
