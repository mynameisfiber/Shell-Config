*easter_date* -- Get Unix timestamp for midnight on Easter of a given year

  int easter_date([int year])~

Returns the Unix timestamp corresponding to midnight on Easter of the given
year.

This function will generate a warning if the year is outside of the range for
Unix timestamps (i.e. before 1970 or after 2037).

The date of Easter Day was defined by the Council of Nicaea in AD325 as the
Sunday after the first full moon which falls on or after the Spring Equinox.
The Equinox is assumed to always fall on 21st March, so the calculation
reduces to determining the date of the full moon and the date of the following
Sunday. The algorithm used here was introduced around the year 532 by
Dionysius Exiguus. Under the Julian Calendar (for years before 1753) a simple
19-year cycle is used to track the phases of the Moon. Under the Gregorian
Calendar (for years after 1753 - devised by Clavius and Lilius, and introduced
by Pope Gregory XIII in October 1582, and into Britain and its then colonies
in September 1752) two correction factors are added to make the cycle more
accurate.

{year} The year as a number between 1970 an 2037

The easter date as a unix timestamp.

Version Description Since 4.3.0 The {year} parameter is optional and defaults
to the current year according to the local time if omitted.
