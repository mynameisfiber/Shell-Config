1. Required Vim Features                    *quickhigh-required*

This plugin needs a vim compiled with |:sign| support.  Without this an error
is printed and the script will not load.

For speed, this plugin requires |perl| support compiled in.  There is VimL
code for compatibilty, but this will be slow when there are many errors.  The
perl code is in a separate file (quickhigh.perl).

==============================================================================
2. Usage                                    *quickhigh-usage*

Adding signs:

To manually add signs after a |:make| or |:grep| command a mapping is
provided.  By default, this is <Leader>qa and <Plug>QuickHighAdd.  With this
method the user will be prompted for the type of error.

To automatically add signs there are to supplied commands.  They are :Make and
:Grep.

Both methods will add signs in all open buffers and setup an |autocommand| to
add signs in new files that are opened.

Toggle signs:

Sometimes it is desirable to remove the signs temporarily (e.g. to view the
line with vim syntax highlighting only).  This functionality is provided as a
map.  By default, it is set to <Leader>qt and <Plug>QuickHighToggle.

Remove signs:

To get rid of all signs and autocommands the mapping <Leader>qr and
<Plug>QuickHighRemove is provided.

==============================================================================
3. Configuration                            *quickhigh-config*

Mappings:

To change the default maps, redefine one of the <Plug>QuickHigh... maps.  For
example, place the following in a vimrc file: >

    map <Leader>qc <Plug>QuickHighRemove

This might make sense if the notion of clearing something makes more sense
then removing.  The other mappings will remain at the defaults.

Signs:

The signs used by this plugin are configurable.  See |:sign-define| for the
format.  For example, place the following in a vimrc file to remove the ER
text from errors: >

    sign define QuickHighMakeError linehl=Error texthl=Error

In addition, if your compiler generates different messages for errors and
warnings, then it is possible to differentiate them.  This is done by setting
two buffer variables.  These variables are interpreted as regular expressions
passed to |match()|.  One matches errors and the other matches warnings.

If a line would match both errors and warnings, then errors has precedence.
If a line would match neither, then it is assumed to be an error.  If it is
desired to not try and make a match, then that variable should not exist.  For
example, if a C compiler places " warning:" in front of all warnings, but does
not do anything for errors, then place the following in a C ftplugin file (see
|ftplugins| for details): >

    unlet! b:quickhigh_error_re
    let b:quickhigh_warning_re  = "^ warning"
