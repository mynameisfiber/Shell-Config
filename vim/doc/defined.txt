*defined* -- Checks whether a given named constant exists

  bool defined(string name)~

Checks whether the given constant exists and is defined.

If you want to see if a variable exists, use |isset| as |defined| only applies
to constants. If you want to see if a function exists, use |function_exists|.

{name} The constant name.

Returns TRUE if the named constant given by {name} has been defined, FALSE
otherwise.
