*ifx_pconnect* -- Open persistent Informix connection

  resource ifx_pconnect([string database [, string userid [, string password]]])~

|ifx_pconnect| acts very much like |ifx_connect| with two major differences.

First, when connecting, the function would first try to find a (persistent)
link that's already open with the same host, username and password. If one is
found, an identifier for it will be returned instead of opening a new
connection.

Second, the connection to the SQL server will not be closed when the execution
of the script ends. Instead, the link will remain open for future use
(|ifx_close| will not close links established by |ifx_pconnect|).

This type of links is therefore called 'persistent'.

All of the arguments are optional, and if they're missing, defaults are taken
from values supplied in php.ini (ifx.default_host for the host (Informix
libraries will use INFORMIXSERVER environment value if not defined),
ifx.default_user for user, ifx.default_password for the password (none if not
defined).

{database} The database name, as a string.

{userid} The username, as a string.

{password} The password, as a string.

Returns: valid Informix persistent link identifier on success, or FALSE on
errors.
