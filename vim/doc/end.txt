*end* -- Set the internal pointer of an array to its last element

  mixed end(array array)~

|end| advances {array}'s internal pointer to the last element, and returns its
value.

{array} The array. This array is passed by reference because it is modified by
the function. This means you must pass it a real variable and not a function
returning an array because only actual variables may be passed by reference.

Returns the value of the last element or FALSE for empty array.

|end| example

<?php >
  $fruits = array('apple', 'banana', 'cranberry');
  echo end($fruits); // cranberry
?>
