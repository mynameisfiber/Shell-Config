|pg_select| example

<?php >
    $db = pg_connect('dbname=foo');
    // This is safe, since $_POST is converted automatically
    $rec = pg_select($db, 'post_log', $_POST);
    if ($rec) {
        echo "Records selected\n";
        var_dump($rec);
    } else {
        echo "User must have sent wrong inputs\n";
    }
?>
