*imagecolorresolvealpha* -- Get the index of the specified color + alpha or its
closest possible alternative

  int imagecolorresolvealpha(resource image, int red, int green, int blue, int alpha)~

This function is guaranteed to return a color index for a requested color,
either the exact color or the closest possible alternative.

{ image}An image resource, returned by one of the image creation functions,
such as |imagecreatetruecolor|.

{red} Value of red component.

{green} Value of green component.

{blue} Value of blue component.

{alpha} A value between 0 and 127. 0 indicates completely opaque while 127
indicates completely transparent.

The colors parameters are integers between 0 and 255 or hexadecimals between
0x00 and 0xFF.

Returns a color index.

Using |imagecoloresolvealpha| to get colors from an image

<?php >
  // Load an image
  $im = imagecreatefromgif('phplogo.gif');
  
  // Get closest colors from the image
  $colors = array();
  $colors[] = imagecolorresolvealpha($im, 255, 255, 255, 0);
  $colors[] = imagecolorresolvealpha($im, 0, 0, 200, 127);
  
  // Output
  print_r($colors);
  
  imagedestroy($im);
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Array
  (
      [0] => 89
      [1] => 85
  )

This function requires GD 2.0.1 or later (2.0.28 or later is recommended).
