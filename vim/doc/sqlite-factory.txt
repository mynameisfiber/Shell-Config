*sqlite_factory* -- Opens an SQLite database and returns an SQLiteDatabase
object

  SQLiteDatabase sqlite_factory(string filename [, int mode [, string error_message]])~

|sqlite_factory| behaves similarly to |sqlite_open| in that it opens an SQLite
database or attempts to create it if it does not exist. However, a
SQLiteDatabase object is returned rather than a resource. Please see the
|sqlite_open| reference page for further usage and caveats.

{filename} The filename of the SQLite database.

{mode} The mode of the file. Intended to be used to open the database in
read-only mode. Presently, this parameter is ignored by the sqlite library.
The default value for mode is the octal value 0666 and this is the recommended
value.

{error_message} Passed by reference and is set to hold a descriptive error
message explaining why the database could not be opened if there was an error.

Returns an SQLiteDatabase object on success, NULL on error.

|sqlite_factory| example

<?php >
  $dbhandle = sqlite_factory('sqlitedb');
  $dbhandle->query('SELECT user_id, username FROM users');
  
  /* functionally equivalent to: */
  
  $dbhandle = new SQLiteDatabase('sqlitedb');
  $dbhandle->query('SELECT user_id, username FROM users');
?>
