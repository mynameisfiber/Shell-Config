*nsapi_request_headers* -- Fetch all HTTP request headers

  array nsapi_request_headers()~

|nsapi_request_headers| gets all the HTTP headers in the current request. This
is only supported when PHP runs as a NSAPI module.

Prior to PHP 4.3.3, |getallheaders| was only available for the Apache servers.
After PHP 4.3.3, |getallheaders| is an alias for |nsapi_request_headers| if
you use the NSAPI module.

You can also get at the value of the common CGI variables by reading them from
the $_SERVER superglobal, which works whether or not you are using PHP as a
NSAPI module.

Returns an associative array with all the HTTP headers.

|nsapi_request_headers| example

<?php >
  $headers = nsapi_request_headers();
  
  foreach ($headers as $header => $value) {
    echo "$header: $value <br />\n";
  }
?>
