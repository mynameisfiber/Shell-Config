*fscanf* -- Parses input from a file according to a format

  mixed fscanf(resource handle, string format [, mixed ...])~

The function |fscanf| is similar to |sscanf|, but it takes its input from a
file associated with {handle} and interprets the input according to the
specified {format}, which is described in the documentation for |sprintf|.

Any whitespace in the format string matches any whitespace in the input
stream. This means that even a tab \t in the format string can match a single
space character in the input stream.

Each call to |fscanf| reads one line from the file.

{handle} A file system pointer resource that is typically created using
|fopen|.

{format} The specified format as described in the |sprintf| documentation.

{...} The optional assigned values.

If only two parameters were passed to this function, the values parsed will be
returned as an array. Otherwise, if optional parameters are passed, the
function will return the number of assigned values. The optional parameters
must be passed by reference.

Version Description 4.3.0 Before this time, the maximum number of characters
read from the file was 512 (or up to the first \n, whichever came first). But
now, arbitrarily long lines will be read and scanned.

|fscanf| Example

<?php >
  $handle = fopen("users.txt", "r");
  while ($userinfo = fscanf($handle, "%s\t%s\t%s\n")) {
      list ($name, $profession, $countrycode) = $userinfo;
      //... do something with the values
  }
  fclose($handle);
?>
