*openssl_pkcs7_verify* -- Verifies the signature of an S/MIME signed message

  mixed openssl_pkcs7_verify(string filename, int flags [, string outfilename [, array cainfo [, string extracerts [, string content]]]])~

|openssl_pkcs7_verify| reads the S/MIME message contained in the given file
and examines the digital signature.

{filename} Path to the message.

{flags} {flags} can be used to affect how the signature is verified - see
PKCS7 constants for more information.

{outfilename} If the {outfilename} is specified, it should be a string holding
the name of a file into which the certificates of the persons that signed the
messages will be stored in PEM format.

{cainfo} If the {cainfo} is specified, it should hold information about the
trusted CA certificates to use in the verification process - see certificate
verification for more information about this parameter.

{extracerts} If the {extracerts} is specified, it is the filename of a file
containing a bunch of certificates to use as untrusted CAs.

{content} You can specify a filename with {content} that will be filled with
the verified data, but with the signature information stripped.

Returns TRUE if the signature is verified, FALSE if it is not correct (the
message has been tampered with, or the signing certificate is invalid), or -1
on error.

Version Description 5.1.0 The {content} parameter was added.

As specified in RFC 2045, lines may not be longer than 76 characters in the
{filename} parameter.
