functions or classes which already exist in the currently running environment
will be automatically overwritten by their new definitions.

{filename} Filename to import function and class definitions from

{flags} Bitwise OR of the RUNKIT_IMPORT_* family of constants.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.
