This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

Returns the special root object at the top of an otherwise empty data graph.
This call is used when the application wants to create a data graph from
scratch, without having called |executeQuery| to create a data graph.

The special root object has one multi-valued containment property, with a name
of the application root type that was passed when the Relational DAS was
constructed. The property can take values of only that type. The only thing
that the application can usefully do with the root type is to call
|createDataObject| on it, passing the name of the application root type, in
order to create a data object of their own application type.

None.

The root object.

None.

Please see the Examples section in the general information about the
Relational DAS for many examples of calling this method.
