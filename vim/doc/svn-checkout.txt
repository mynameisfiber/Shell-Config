*svn_checkout* -- Checks out a working copy from the repository

  bool svn_checkout(string repos, string targetpath [, int revision [, int flags]])~

Checks out a working copy from the repository at {repos} to {targetpath} at
revision {revision}.

{repos} String URL path to directory in repository to check out.

{targetpath} String local path to directory to check out in to

Relative paths will be resolved as if the current working directory was the
one that contains the PHP binary. To use the calling script"s working
directory, use |realpath| or dirname(__FILE__).

{revision} Integer revision number of repository to check out. Default is
HEAD, the most recent revision.

{flags} Any combination of SVN_NON_RECURSIVE and SVN_IGNORE_EXTERNALS.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

Basic example This example demonstrates how to check out a directory from a
repository to a directory named calc:

<?php >
  svn_checkout('http://www.example.com/svnroot/calc/trunk', dirname(__FILE__) . '/calc');
?>

The dirname(__FILE__) call is necessary in order to convert the calc relative
path into an absolute one. If calc exists, you can also use |realpath| to
retrieve an absolute path.
