*fbsql_db_status* -- Get the status for a given database

  int fbsql_db_status(string database_name [, resource link_identifier])~

Gets the current status of the specified database.

{database_name} The database name.

{ link_identifier}A FrontBase link identifier returned by |fbsql_connect| or
|fbsql_pconnect|.

If optional and not specified, the function will try to find an open link to
the FrontBase server and if no such link is found it will try to create one as
if |fbsql_connect| was called with no arguments.

Returns an integer value with the current status. This can be one of the
following constants: FALSE - The exec handler for the host was invalid. This
error will occur when the {link_identifier} connects directly to a database by
using a port number. FBExec can be available on the server but no connection
has been made for it.

FBSQL_UNKNOWN - The Status is unknown.

FBSQL_STOPPED - The database is not running. Use |fbsql_start_db| to start the
database.

FBSQL_STARTING - The database is starting.

FBSQL_RUNNING - The database is running and can be used to perform SQL
operations.

FBSQL_STOPPING - The database is stopping.

FBSQL_NOEXEC - FBExec is not running on the server and it is not possible to
get the status of the database.

|fbsql_start_db| |fbsql_stop_db|
