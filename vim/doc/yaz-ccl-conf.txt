*yaz_ccl_conf* -- Configure CCL parser

  void yaz_ccl_conf(resource id, array config)~

This function configures the CCL query parser for a server with definitions of
access points (CCL qualifiers) and their mapping to RPN.

To map a specific CCL query to RPN afterwards call the |yaz_ccl_parse|
function.

{id} The connection resource returned by |yaz_connect|.

{config} An array of configuration. Each key of the array is the name of a CCL
field and the corresponding value holds a string that specifies a mapping to
RPN.

The mapping is a sequence of attribute-type, attribute-value pairs.
Attribute-type and attribute-value is separated by an equal sign (=). Each
pair is separated by white space.

Additional information can be found on the CCL page.

No value is returned.

In the example below, the CCL parser is configured to support three CCL
fields: ti, au and isbn. Each field is mapped to their BIB-1 equivalent. It is
assumed that variable $id is the connection ID.

<?php >
  $fields = array(
    "ti" => "1=4",
    "au"   => "1=1",
    "isbn" => "1=7"
  );
  yaz_ccl_conf($id, $fields);
?>
