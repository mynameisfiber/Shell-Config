*imagepstext* -- Draws a text over an image using PostScript Type1 fonts

  array imagepstext(resource image, string text, resource font_index, int size, int foreground, int background, int x, int y [, int space [, int tightness [, float angle [, int antialias_steps]]]])~

Draws a text on an image using PostScript Type1 fonts.

Refer to PostScript documentation about fonts and their measuring system if
you have trouble understanding how this works.

{ image}An image resource, returned by one of the image creation functions,
such as |imagecreatetruecolor|.

{text} The text to be written.

{font_index} A font resource, returned by |imagepsloadfont|.

{size} {size} is expressed in pixels.

{foreground} The color in which the text will be painted.

{background} The color to which the text will try to fade in with
antialiasing. No pixels with the color {background} are actually painted, so
the background image does not need to be of solid color.

{x} x-coordinate for the lower-left corner of the first character.

{y} y-coordinate for the lower-left corner of the first character.

{space} Allows you to change the default value of a space in a font. This
amount is added to the normal value and can also be negative. Expressed in
character space units, where 1 unit is 1/1000th of an em-square.

{tightness} {tightness} allows you to control the amount of white space
between characters. This amount is added to the normal character width and can
also be negative. Expressed in character space units, where 1 unit is 1/1000th
of an em-square.

{angle} {angle} is in degrees.

{antialias_steps} Allows you to control the number of colours used for
antialiasing text. Allowed values are 4 and 16. The higher value is
recommended for text sizes lower than 20, where the effect in text quality is
quite visible. With bigger sizes, use 4. It's less computationally intensive.

This function returns an array containing the following elements: 0 lower left
x-coordinate 1 lower left y-coordinate 2 upper right x-coordinate 3 upper
right y-coordinate

|imagepstext| usage

<?php >
  // Create image handle
  $im = imagecreatetruecolor(200, 200);
  
  // Allocate colors
  $black = imagecolorallocate($im, 0, 0, 0);
  $white = imagecolorallocate($im, 255, 255, 255);
  
  // Load the PostScript Font
  $font = imagepsloadfont('font.pfm');
  
  // Write the font to the image
  imagepstext($im, 'Sample text is simple', $font, 12, $black, $white, 50, 50);
  
  // Output and free memory
  header('Content-type: image/png');
  
  imagepng($im);
  imagedestroy($im);
?>



This function is only available if PHP is compiled using --with-t1lib[=DIR].
