*disk_free_space* -- Returns available space on filesystem or disk partition

  float disk_free_space(string directory)~

Given a string containing a directory, this function will return the number of
bytes available on the corresponding filesystem or disk partition.

{directory} A directory of the filesystem or disk partition.

Given a file name instead of a directory, the behaviour of the function is
unspecified and may differ between operating systems and PHP versions.

Returns the number of available bytes as a float or FALSE on failure.

|disk_free_space| example

<?php >
  // $df contains the number of bytes available on "/"
  $df = disk_free_space("/");
  
  // On Windows:
  $df_c = disk_free_space("C:");
  $df_d = disk_free_space("D:");
?>





This function will not work on remote files as the file to be examined must be
accessible via the server"s filesystem.
