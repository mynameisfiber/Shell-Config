*variant_add* -- "Adds" two variant values together and returns the result

  mixed variant_add(mixed left, mixed right)~

Adds {left} to {right} using the following rules (taken from the MSDN
library), which correspond to those of Visual Basic: Variant Addition Rules If
Then Both expressions are of the string type Concatenation One expression is a
string type and the other a character Addition One expression is numeric and
the other is a string Addition Both expressions are numeric Addition Either
expression is NULL NULL is returned Both expressions are empty Integer subtype
is returned

{left} The left operand.

{right} The right operand.

As with all the variant arithmetic functions, the parameters for this function
can be either a PHP native type (integer, string, floating point, boolean or
NULL), or an instance of a COM, VARIANT or DOTNET class. PHP native types will
be converted to variants using the same rules as found in the constructor for
the class. COM and DOTNET objects will have the value of their default
property taken and used as the variant value.

The variant arithmetic functions are wrappers around the similarly named
functions in the COM library; for more information on these functions, consult
the MSDN library. The PHP functions are named slightly differently; for
example |variant_add| in PHP corresponds to VarAdd() in the MSDN
documentation.

Returns the result.
