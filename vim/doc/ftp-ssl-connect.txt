*ftp_ssl_connect* -- Opens an Secure SSL-FTP connection

  resource ftp_ssl_connect(string host [, int port [, int timeout]])~

|ftp_ssl_connect| opens an explicit SSL-FTP connection to the specified
{host}.

|ftp_ssl_connect| is only available if both the ftp module and the OpenSSL
support is built statically into php, this means that on Windows this function
will be undefined in the official PHP builds. To make this function available
on Windows you must compile your own PHP binaries.

|ftp_ssl_connect| is not intended for use with sFTP. To use sFTP with PHP,
please see |ssh2_sftp|.

{host} The FTP server address. This parameter shouldn't have any trailing
slashes and shouldn't be prefixed with ftp://.

{port} This parameter specifies an alternate port to connect to. If it is
omitted or set to zero, then the default FTP port, 21, will be used.

{timeout} This parameter specifies the timeout for all subsequent network
operations. If omitted, the default value is 90 seconds. The timeout can be
changed and queried at any time with |ftp_set_option| and |ftp_get_option|.

Returns a SSL-FTP stream on success or FALSE on error.

Version Description 5.2.2 The function was changed to return FALSE when it
can't use an SSL connection, instead of fallbacking to a non-SSL one as
previously.

<?php >
  // set up basic ssl connection
  $conn_id = ftp_ssl_connect($ftp_server);
  
  // login with username and password
  $login_result = ftp_login($conn_id, $ftp_user_name, $ftp_user_pass);
  
  echo ftp_pwd($conn_id); // /
  
  // close the ssl connection
  ftp_close($conn_id);
