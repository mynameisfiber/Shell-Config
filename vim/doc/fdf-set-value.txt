*fdf_set_value* -- Set the value of a field

  bool fdf_set_value(resource fdf_document, string fieldname, mixed value [, int isName])~

Sets the {value} for the given field.

{fdf_document} The FDF document handle, returned by |fdf_create|, |fdf_open|
or |fdf_open_string|.

{fieldname} Name of the FDF field, as a string.

{value} This parameter will be stored as a string unless it is an array. In
this case all array elements will be stored as a value array.

{isName} In older versions of the FDF toolkit last parameter determined if the
field value was to be converted to a PDF Name (= 1) or set to a PDF String (=
0).

The value is no longer used in the current toolkit version 5.0. For
compatibility reasons it is still supported as an optional parameter beginning
with PHP 4.3, but ignored internally.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

Version Description 4.3.0 Support for arrays in the {value} parameter was
added.
