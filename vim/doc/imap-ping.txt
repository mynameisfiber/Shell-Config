*imap_ping* -- Check if the IMAP stream is still active

  bool imap_ping(resource imap_stream)~

|imap_ping| pings the stream to see if it's still active. It may discover new
mail; this is the preferred method for a periodic "new mail check" as well as
a "keep alive" for servers which have inactivity timeout.

{ imap_stream}An IMAP stream returned by |imap_open|.

Returns TRUE if the stream is still alive, FALSE otherwise.

|imap_ping| Example

<?php >
  $imap = imap_open("{imap.example.org}", "mailadmin", "password");
  
  // after some sleeping
  if (!imap_ping($imap)) {
      // do some stuff to reconnect
  }
?>
