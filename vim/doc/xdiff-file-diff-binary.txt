*xdiff_file_diff_binary* -- Alias of xdiff_file_bdiff

  bool xdiff_file_diff_binary(string old_file, string new_file, string dest)~

Makes a binary diff of two files and stores the result in a patch file. This
function works with both text and binary files. Resulting patch file can be
later applied using |xdiff_file_bpatch|.

Starting with version 1.5.0 this function is an alias of |xdiff_file_bdiff|.

{old_file} Path to the first file. This file acts as "old" file.

{new_file} Path to the second file. This file acts as "new" file.

{dest} Path of the resulting patch file. Resulting file contains differences
between "old" and "new" files. It is in binary format and is human-unreadable.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

|xdiff_file_diff_binary| example The following code makes binary diff of two
archives.

<?php >
  $old_version = 'my_script_1.0.tgz';
  $new_version = 'my_script_1.1.tgz';
  
  xdiff_file_diff_binary($old_version, $new_version, 'my_script.bdiff');
?>



Both files will be loaded into memory so ensure that your memory_limit is set
high enough.
