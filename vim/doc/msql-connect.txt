*msql_connect* -- Open mSQL connection

  resource msql_connect([string hostname])~

|msql_connect| establishes a connection to a mSQL server.

In case a second call is made to |msql_connect| with the same arguments, no
new link will be established, but instead, the link identifier of the already
opened link will be returned.

The link to the server will be closed as soon as the execution of the script
ends, unless it's closed earlier by explicitly calling |msql_close|.

{hostname} The hostname can also include a port number. e.g. hostname,port.

If not specified, the connection is established by the means of a Unix domain
socket, being then more efficient then a localhost TCP socket connection.

While this function will accept a colon (:) as a host/port separator, a comma
(,) is the preferred method.

Returns a positive mSQL link identifier on success, or FALSE on error.
