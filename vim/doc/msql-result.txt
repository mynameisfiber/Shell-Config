*msql_result* -- Get result data

  string msql_result(resource result, int row [, mixed field])~

|msql_result| returns the contents of one cell from a mSQL result set.

When working on large result sets, you should consider using one of the
functions that fetch an entire row (specified below). As these functions
return the contents of multiple cells in one function call, they are often
much quicker than |msql_result|.

Recommended high-performance alternatives: |msql_fetch_row|,
|msql_fetch_array|, and |msql_fetch_object|.

{ result}The result resource that is being evaluated. This result comes from a
call to |msql_query|.

{row} The row offset.

{field} Can be the field's offset, or the field's name, or the field's table
dot field's name (tablename.fieldname.). If the column name has been aliased
('select foo as bar from ...'), use the alias instead of the column name.

Specifying a numeric field offset is much quicker than specifying a fieldname
or tablename.fieldname.

Returns the contents of the cell at the row and offset in the specified mSQL
result set.
