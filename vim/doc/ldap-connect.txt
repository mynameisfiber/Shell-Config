*ldap_connect* -- Connect to an LDAP server

  resource ldap_connect([string hostname [, int port]])~

Establishes a connection to a LDAP server on a specified {hostname} and
{port}.

{hostname} If you are using OpenLDAP 2.x.x you can specify a URL instead of
the hostname. To use LDAP with SSL, compile OpenLDAP 2.x.x with SSL support,
configure PHP with SSL, and set this parameter as ldaps://hostname/.

{port} The port to connect to. Not used when using URLs.

Returns a positive LDAP link identifier on success, or FALSE on error. When
OpenLDAP 2.x.x is used, |ldap_connect| will always return a resource as it
does not actually connect but just initializes the connecting parameters. The
actual connect happens with the next calls to ldap_* funcs, usually with
|ldap_bind|.

If no arguments are specified then the link identifier of the already opened
link will be returned.

Version Description 4.0.4 URL and SSL support was added.

Example of connecting to LDAP server.

<?php >
  // LDAP variables
  $ldaphost = "ldap.example.com";  // your ldap servers
  $ldapport = 389;                 // your ldap server's port number
  
  // Connecting to LDAP
  $ldapconn = ldap_connect($ldaphost, $ldapport)
            or die("Could not connect to $ldaphost");
?>



Example of connecting securely to LDAP server.

<?php >
  // make sure your host is the correct one
  // that you issued your secure certificate to
  $ldaphost = "ldaps://ldap.example.com/";
  
  // Connecting to LDAP
  $ldapconn = ldap_connect($ldaphost)
            or die("Could not connect to {$ldaphost}");
?>
