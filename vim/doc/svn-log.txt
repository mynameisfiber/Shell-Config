*svn_log* -- Returns the commit log messages of a repository URL

  array svn_log(string repos_url [, int start_revision [, int end_revision [, int limit [, int flags]]]])~

|svn_log| returns the complete history of the item at the repository URL
{repos_url}, or the history of a specific revision if {start_revision} is set.
This function is equivalent to svn log --verbose -r $start_revision
$repos_url.

For repositories with large histories, the output may be quite large (one
array item for every revision of the item). This function does not support the
--limit NUM flag, nor does it support revision ranges (start_revision must be
an integer).

{repos_url} Repository URL of the item to retrieve log history from.

{start_revision} Revision number of the first log to retrieve. Use
SVN_REVISION_HEAD to retrieve the log from the most recent revision.

{end_revision} Revision number of the last log to retrieve. Defaults to
{start_revision} if specified or to SVN_REVISION_INITIAL otherwise.

{limit} Number of logs to retrieve.

{flags} Any combination of SVN_OMIT_MESSAGES, SVN_DISCOVER_CHANGED_PATHS and
SVN_STOP_ON_COPY.

On success, this function returns an array file listing in the format of:

  [0] => Array, ordered most recent (highest) revision first
  (
      [rev] => integer revision number
      [author] => string author name
      [msg] => string log message
      [date] => string date formatted per ISO 8601, i.e. date('c')
      [paths] => Array, describing changed files
          (
              [0] => Array
                  (
                      [action] => string letter signifying change
                      [path] =>  absolute repository path of changed file
                  )
              [1] => ...
          )
  )
  [1] => ...



The output will always be a numerically indexed array of arrays, even when
there are none or only one log message(s).

The value of action is a subset of the status output in the first column,
where possible values are:

If no changes were made to the item, an empty array is returned.

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

|svn_log| example

<?php >
  print_r( svn_log('http://www.example.com/', 23) );
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Array
  (
      [0] => Array
      (
          [rev] => 23
          [author] => 'joe'
          [msg] => 'Add cheese and salami to our sandwich.'
          [date] => '2007-04-06T16:00:27-04:00'
          [paths] => Array
              (
                  [0] => Array
                      (
                          [action] => 'M'
                          [path] =>  '/sandwich.txt'
                      )
              )
      )
  )
