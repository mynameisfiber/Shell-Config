*wincache_ucache_info* -- Retrieves information about data stored in the user
cache

  array wincache_ucache_info([bool summaryonly [, string key]])~

Retrieves information about data stored in the user cache.

{summaryonly} Controls whether the returned array will contain information
about individual cache entries along with the user cache summary.

{key} The key of an entry in the user cache. If specified then the returned
array will contain information only about that cache entry. If not specified
and {summaryonly} is set to false then the returned array will contain
information about all entries in the cache.

Array of meta data about user cache or FALSE on failure

The array returned by this function contains the following elements:
total_cache_uptime - total time in seconds that the user cache has been active

total_item_count - total number of elements that are currently in the user
cache

is_local_cache - true is the cache metadata is for a local cache instance,
false if the metadata is for the global cache

total_hit_count - number of times the data has been served from the cache

total_miss_count - number of times the data has not been found in the cache

ucache_entries - an array that contains the information about all the cached
items: key_name - name of the key which is used to store the data

value_type - type of value stored by the key

use_time - time in seconds since the file has been accessed in the opcode
cache

last_check - time in seconds since the file has been checked for modifications

is_session - indicates if the data is a session variable

ttl_seconds - time remaining for the data to live in the cache, 0 meaning
infinite

age_seconds - time elapsed from the time data has been added in the cache

hitcount - number of times data has been served from the cache

Using |wincache_ucache_info|

<?php >
  wincache_ucache_get('green');
  wincache_ucache_set('green', 2922);
  wincache_ucache_get('green');
  wincache_ucache_get('green');
  wincache_ucache_get('green');
  print_r(wincache_ucache_info());
?>

The above example will output:

  Array 
  ( ["total_cache_uptime"] => int(0)
    ["is_local_cache"] => bool(false)
    ["total_item_count"] => int(1) 
    ["total_hit_count"] => int(3) 
    ["total_miss_count"] => int(1) 
    ["ucache_entries"] => Array(1) 
      ( [1] => Array(6)
        ( 
          ["key_name"] => string(5) "green"
          ["value_type"] => string(4) "long" 
          ["is_session"] => int(0) 
          ["ttl_seconds"] => int(0)
          ["age_seconds"] => int(0)
          ["hitcount"] => int(3) 
         ) 
      ) 
  )
