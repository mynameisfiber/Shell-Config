Get result data

{result_id} The ODBC resource.

{field} The field name being retrieved. It can either be an integer containing
the column number of the field you want; or it can be a string containing the
name of the field.

Returns the string contents of the field, FALSE on error, NULL for NULL data,
or TRUE for binary data.

The first call to |odbc_result| returns the value of the third field in the
current record of the query result. The second function call to |odbc_result|
returns the value of the field whose field name is "val" in the current record
of the query result. An error occurs if a column number parameter for a field
is less than one or exceeds the number of columns (or fields) in the current
record. Similarly, an error occurs if a field with a name that is not one of
the fieldnames of the table(s) that is(are) being queried.

|odbc_result| examples

<?php >
  $item_3   = odbc_result($Query_ID, 3);
  $item_val = odbc_result($Query_ID, "val");
?>





Field indices start from 1. Regarding the way binary or long column data is
returned refer to |odbc_binmode| and |odbc_longreadlen|.
