*ps_circle* -- Draws a circle

  bool ps_circle(resource psdoc, float x, float y, float radius)~

Draws a circle with its middle point at ({x}, {y}). The circle starts and ends
at position ({x}+{radius}, {y}). If this function is called outside a path it
will start a new path. If it is called within a path it will add the circle as
a subpath. If the last drawing operation does not end in point ({x}+{radius},
{y}) then there will be a gap in the path.

{psdoc} Resource identifier of the postscript file as returned by |ps_new|.

{x} The x-coordinate of the circle's middle point.

{y} The y-coordinate of the circle's middle point.

{radius} The radius of the circle

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.
