*odbc_autocommit* -- Toggle autocommit behaviour

  mixed odbc_autocommit(resource connection_id [, bool OnOff])~

Toggles autocommit behaviour.

By default, auto-commit is on for a connection. Disabling auto-commit is
equivalent with starting a transaction.

{connection_id} The ODBC connection identifier, see |odbc_connect| for
details.

{OnOff} If {OnOff} is TRUE, auto-commit is enabled, if it is FALSE auto-commit
is disabled.

Without the {OnOff} parameter, this function returns auto-commit status for
{connection_id}. Non-zero is returned if auto-commit is on, 0 if it is off, or
FALSE if an error occurs.

If {OnOff} is set, this function returns TRUE on success and FALSE on failure.
