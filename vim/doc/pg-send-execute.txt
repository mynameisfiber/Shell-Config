*pg_send_execute* -- Sends a request to execute a prepared statement with given
parameters, without waiting for the result(s).

  bool pg_send_execute(resource connection, string stmtname, array params)~

Sends a request to execute a prepared statement with given parameters, without
waiting for the result(s).

This is similar to |pg_send_query_params|, but the command to be executed is
specified by naming a previously-prepared statement, instead of giving a query
string. The function's parameters are handled identically to |pg_execute|.
Like |pg_execute|, it will not work on pre-7.4 versions of PostgreSQL.

{connection} PostgreSQL database connection resource. When {connection} is not
present, the default connection is used. The default connection is the last
connection made by |pg_connect| or |pg_pconnect|.

{stmtname} The name of the prepared statement to execute. if "" is specified,
then the unnamed statement is executed. The name must have been previously
prepared using |pg_prepare|, |pg_send_prepare| or a PREPARE SQL command.

{params} An array of parameter values to substitute for the $1, $2, etc.
placeholders in the original prepared query string. The number of elements in
the array must match the number of placeholders.

Returns TRUE on success, FALSE on failure. Use |pg_get_result| to determine
the query result.

Using |pg_send_execute|

<?php >
    $dbconn = pg_connect("dbname=publisher") or die("Could not connect");
  
    // Prepare a query for execution
    if (!pg_connection_busy($dbconn)) {
      pg_send_prepare($dbconn, "my_query", 'SELECT * FROM shops WHERE name = $1');
      $res1 = pg_get_result($dbconn);
    }
  
    // Execute the prepared query.  Note that it is not necessary to escape
    // the string "Joe's Widgets" in any way
    if (!pg_connection_busy($dbconn)) {
      pg_send_execute($dbconn, "my_query", array("Joe's Widgets"));
      $res2 = pg_get_result($dbconn);
    }
    
    // Execute the same prepared query, this time with a different parameter
    if (!pg_connection_busy($dbconn)) {
      pg_send_execute($dbconn, "my_query", array("Clothes Clothes Clothes"));
      $res3 = pg_get_result($dbconn);
    }
?>
