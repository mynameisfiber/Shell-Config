*hw_InCollections* -- Check if object ids in collections

  array hw_incollections(int connection, array object_id_array, array collection_id_array, int return_collections)~

Checks whether a set of objects (documents or collections) specified by the
{object_id_array} is part of the collections listed in {collection_id_array}.

{connection} The connection identifier.

{object_id_array} An array of object ids.

{collection_id_array} An array of collection ids.

{return_collections} When set to 0, the subset of object ids that is part of
the collections (i.e., the documents or collections that are children of one
or more collections of collection ids or their subcollections, recursively) is
returned as an array.

When set to 1, the set of collections that have one or more objects of this
subset as children are returned as an array. This option allows a client to,
e.g., highlight the part of the collection hierarchy that contains the matches
of a previous query, in a graphical overview.

Returns an array of object ids.
