*is_dir* -- Tells whether the filename is a directory

  bool is_dir(string filename)~

Tells whether the given filename is a directory.

{filename} Path to the file. If {filename} is a relative filename, it will be
checked relative to the current working directory. If {filename} is a symbolic
or hard link then the link will be resolved and checked. If you have enabled
safe mode, or open_basedir further restrictions may apply.

Returns TRUE if the filename exists and is a directory, FALSE otherwise.
