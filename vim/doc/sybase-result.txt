*sybase_result* -- Get result data

  string sybase_result(resource result, int row, mixed field)~

Returns the contents of the cell at the row and offset in the specified Sybase
result set.

When working on large result sets, you should consider using one of the
functions that fetch an entire row (specified below). As these functions
return the contents of multiple cells in one function call, they're MUCH
quicker than sybase_result(). Also, note that specifying a numeric offset for
the field argument is much quicker than specifying a fieldname or
tablename.fieldname argument.

Recommended high-performance alternatives: |sybase_fetch_row|,
|sybase_fetch_array| and |sybase_fetch_object|.

{result}

{row}

{field} The field argument can be the field's offset, or the field's name, or
the field's table dot field's name (tablename.fieldname). If the column name
has been aliased ('select foo as bar from...'), use the alias instead of the
column name.

|sybase_result| returns the contents of one cell from a Sybase result set.
