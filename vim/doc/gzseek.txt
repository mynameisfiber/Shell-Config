*gzseek* -- Seek on a gz-file pointer

  int gzseek(resource zp, int offset [, int whence])~

Sets the file position indicator for the given file pointer to the given
offset byte into the file stream. Equivalent to calling (in C) gzseek(zp,
offset, SEEK_SET).

If the file is opened for reading, this function is emulated but can be
extremely slow. If the file is opened for writing, only forward seeks are
supported; |gzseek| then compresses a sequence of zeroes up to the new
starting position.

{zp} The gz-file pointer. It must be valid, and must point to a file
successfully opened by |gzopen|.

{offset} The seeked offset.

{whence} {whence} values are: SEEK_SET - Set position equal to {offset} bytes.
SEEK_CUR - Set position to current location plus {offset}.

If {whence} is not specified, it is assumed to be SEEK_SET.

Upon success, returns 0; otherwise, returns -1. Note that seeking past EOF is
not considered an error.

|gzseek| example

<?php >
  $gz = gzopen('somefile.gz', 'r');
  gzseek($gz,2);
  echo gzgetc($gz);
  gzclose($gz);
?>
