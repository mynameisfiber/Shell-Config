*px_delete_record* -- Deletes record from paradox database

  bool px_delete_record(resource pxdoc, int num)~

in the database file but just marks it as deleted. Inserting a new record
afterwards will reuse the space.

This function is only available if pxlib >= 0.6.0 is used.

{pxdoc} Resource identifier of the paradox database as returned by |px_new|.

{num} The record number is an artificial number counting records in the order
as they are stored in the database. The first record has number 0.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.
