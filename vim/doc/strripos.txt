*strripos* -- Find position of last occurrence of a case-insensitive string in a
string

  int strripos(string haystack, string needle [, int offset])~

Find position of last occurrence of a case-insensitive string in a string.
Unlike |strrpos|, |strripos| is case-insensitive.

{haystack} The string to search in

{needle} Note that the {needle} may be a string of one or more characters.

{offset} The {offset} parameter may be specified to begin searching an
arbitrary number of characters into the string.

Negative offset values will start the search at {offset} characters from the
start of the string.

Returns the numerical position of the last occurrence of {needle}. Also note
that string positions start at 0, and not 1.

If {needle} is not found, FALSE is returned.

This function may return Boolean FALSE, but may also return a non-Boolean
value which evaluates to FALSE, such as 0 or "". Please read the section on
Booleans for more information. Use the === operator for testing the return
value of this function.

A simple |strripos| example

<?php >
  $haystack = 'ababcd';
  $needle   = 'aB';
  
  $pos      = strripos($haystack, $needle);
  
  if ($pos === false) {
      echo "Sorry, we did not find ($needle) in ($haystack)";
  } else {
      echo "Congratulations!\n";
      echo "We found the last ($needle) in ($haystack) at position ($pos)";
  }
?>

The above example will output:

  Congratulations!
     We found the last (aB) in (ababcd) at position (2)
