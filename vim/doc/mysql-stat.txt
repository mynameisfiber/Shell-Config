*mysql_stat* -- Get current system status

  string mysql_stat([resource link_identifier])~

|mysql_stat| returns the current server status.

{ link_identifier}The MySQL connection. If the link identifier is not
specified, the last link opened by |mysql_connect| is assumed. If no such link
is found, it will try to create one as if |mysql_connect| was called with no
arguments. If no connection is found or established, an E_WARNING level error
is generated.

Returns a string with the status for uptime, threads, queries, open tables,
flush tables and queries per second. For a complete list of other status
variables, you have to use the SHOW STATUS SQL command. If {link_identifier}
is invalid, NULL is returned.

|mysql_stat| example

<?php >
  $link   = mysql_connect('localhost', 'mysql_user', 'mysql_password');
  $status = explode('  ', mysql_stat($link));
  print_r($status);
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Array
  (
      [0] => Uptime: 5380
      [1] => Threads: 2
      [2] => Questions: 1321299
      [3] => Slow queries: 0
      [4] => Opens: 26
      [5] => Flush tables: 1
      [6] => Open tables: 17
      [7] => Queries per second avg: 245.595
  )



Alternative |mysql_stat| example

<?php >
  $link   = mysql_connect('localhost', 'mysql_user', 'mysql_password');
  $result = mysql_query('SHOW STATUS', $link);
  while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) {
      echo $row['Variable_name'] . ' = ' . $row['Value'] . "\n";
  }
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  back_log = 50
  basedir = /usr/local/
  bdb_cache_size = 8388600
  bdb_log_buffer_size = 32768
  bdb_home = /var/db/mysql/
  bdb_max_lock = 10000
  bdb_logdir =
  bdb_shared_data = OFF
  bdb_tmpdir = /var/tmp/
