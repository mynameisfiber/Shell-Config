*get_browser* -- Tells what the user's browser is capable of

  mixed get_browser([string user_agent [, bool return_array]])~

Attempts to determine the capabilities of the user's browser, by looking up
the browser's information in the browscap.ini file.

{user_agent} The User Agent to be analyzed. By default, the value of HTTP
User-Agent header is used; however, you can alter this (i.e., look up another
browser's info) by passing this parameter.

You can bypass this parameter with a NULL value.

{return_array} If set to TRUE, this function will return an array instead of
an object.

The information is returned in an object or an array which will contain
various data elements representing, for instance, the browser's major and
minor version numbers and ID string; TRUE/FALSE values for features such as
frames, JavaScript, and cookies; and so forth.

The cookies value simply means that the browser itself is capable of accepting
cookies and does not mean the user has enabled the browser to accept cookies
or not. The only way to test if cookies are accepted is to set one with
|setcookie|, reload, and check for the value.

Version Description 4.3.2 The optional parameter {return_array} was added.

Listing all information about the users browser

<?php >
  echo $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] . "\n\n";
  
  $browser = get_browser(null, true);
  print_r($browser);
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3
  
  Array

In order for this to work, your browscap configuration setting in php.ini must
point to the correct location of the browscap.ini file on your system.

browscap.ini is not bundled with PHP, but you may find an up-to-date
php_browscap.ini file here.

While browscap.ini contains information on many browsers, it relies on user
updates to keep the database current. The format of the file is fairly
self-explanatory.
