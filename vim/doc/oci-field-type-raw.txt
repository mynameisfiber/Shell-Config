*oci_field_type_raw* -- Tell the raw Oracle data type of the field

  int oci_field_type_raw(resource statement, int field)~

Returns Oracle's raw data type of the {field}.

However, if you want to get field's type, then |oci_field_type| will suit you
better.

{statement} A valid OCI statement identifier.

{field} Can be the field's index (1-based) or name.

Returns Oracle's raw data type as a string, or FALSE on errors.

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ocicolumntyperaw| instead. This
name still can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_field_type_raw| for
downwards compatability. This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.
