*session_destroy* -- Destroys all data registered to a session

  bool session_destroy()~

|session_destroy| destroys all of the data associated with the current
session. It does not unset any of the global variables associated with the
session, or unset the session cookie. To use the session variables again,
|session_start| has to be called.

In order to kill the session altogether, like to log the user out, the session
id must also be unset. If a cookie is used to propagate the session id
(default behavior), then the session cookie must be deleted. |setcookie| may
be used for that.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

Destroying a session with $_SESSION

<?php >
  // Initialize the session.
  // If you are using session_name("something"), don't forget it now!
  session_start();
  
  // Unset all of the session variables.
  $_SESSION = array();
  
  // If it's desired to kill the session, also delete the session cookie.
  // Note: This will destroy the session, and not just the session data!
  if (ini_get("session.use_cookies")) {
      $params = session_get_cookie_params();
      setcookie(session_name(), '', time() - 42000,
          $params["path"], $params["domain"],
          $params["secure"], $params["httponly"]
      );
  }
  
  // Finally, destroy the session.
  session_destroy();
?>





Only use |session_unset| for older deprecated code that does not use
$_SESSION.

|unset| |setcookie|
