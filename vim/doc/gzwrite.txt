*gzwrite* -- Binary-safe gz-file write

  int gzwrite(resource zp, string string [, int length])~

|gzwrite| writes the contents of {string} to the given gz-file.

{zp} The gz-file pointer. It must be valid, and must point to a file
successfully opened by |gzopen|.

{string} The string to write.

{length} The number of uncompressed bytes to write. If supplied, writing will
stop after {length} (uncompressed) bytes have been written or the end of
{string} is reached, whichever comes first.

Note that if the {length} argument is given, then the magic_quotes_runtime
configuration option will be ignored and no slashes will be stripped from
{string}.

Returns the number of (uncompressed) bytes written to the given gz-file
stream.

|gzwrite| example

<?php >
  $string = 'Some information to compress';
  $gz = gzopen('somefile.gz','w9');
  gzwrite($gz, $string);
  gzclose($gz);
?>
