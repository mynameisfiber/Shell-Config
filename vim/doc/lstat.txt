*lstat* -- Gives information about a file or symbolic link

  array lstat(string filename)~

Gathers the statistics of the file or symbolic link named by {filename}.

{filename} Path to a file or a symbolic link.

See the manual page for |stat| for information on the structure of the array
that |lstat| returns. This function is identical to the |stat| function except
that if the {filename} parameter is a symbolic link, the status of the
symbolic link is returned, not the status of the file pointed to by the
symbolic link.

Comparison of |stat| and |lstat|

<?php >
  symlink('uploads.php', 'uploads');
  
  // Contrast information for uploads.php and uploads
  array_diff(stat('uploads'), lstat('uploads'));
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

Information that differs between the two files.

  Array
  (
      [ino] => 97236376
      [mode] => 33188
      [size] => 34
      [atime] => 1223580003
      [mtime] => 1223581848
      [ctime] => 1223581848
      [blocks] => 8
  )



Upon failure, an E_WARNING is emitted.

The results of this function are cached. See |clearstatcache| for more
details.

As of PHP 5.0.0, this function can also be used with some URL wrappers. Refer
to for a listing of which wrappers support |stat| family of functionality.
