*get_declared_classes* -- Returns an array with the name of the defined classes

  array get_declared_classes()~

Gets the declared classes.

Returns an array of the names of the declared classes in the current script.

Note that depending on what extensions you have compiled or loaded into PHP,
additional classes could be present. This means that you will not be able to
define your own classes using these names. There is a list of predefined
classes in the Predefined Classes section of the appendices.
