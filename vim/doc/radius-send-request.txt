*radius_send_request* -- Sends the request and waites for a reply

  int radius_send_request(resource radius_handle)~

After the Radius request has been constructed, it is sent by
|radius_send_request|.

The |radius_send_request| function sends the request and waits for a valid
reply, retrying the defined servers in round-robin fashion as necessary.

If a valid response is received, |radius_send_request| returns the Radius code
which specifies the type of the response. This will typically be
RADIUS_ACCESS_ACCEPT, RADIUS_ACCESS_REJECT, or RADIUS_ACCESS_CHALLENGE. If no
valid response is received, |radius_send_request| returns FALSE.
