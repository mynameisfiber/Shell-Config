*nsapi_virtual* -- Perform an NSAPI sub-request

  bool nsapi_virtual(string uri)~

|nsapi_virtual| is an NSAPI-specific function which is equivalent to in SSI
(.shtml files). It does an NSAPI sub-request. It is useful for including CGI
scripts or .shtml files, or anything else that you'd parse through webserver.

To run the sub-request, all buffers are terminated and flushed to the browser,
pending headers are sent too.

You cannot make recursive requests with this function to other PHP scripts. If
you want to include PHP scripts, use |include| or |require|.

This function depends on a undocumented feature of the Netscape/iPlanet/Sun
webservers. Use |phpinfo| to determine if it is available. In the Unix
environment it should always work, in Windows it depends on the name of a
ns-httpdXX.dll file.

Read the note about subrequests in the NSAPI section (UNIX, Windows) if you
experience this problem.

{uri} The URI of the script.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.
