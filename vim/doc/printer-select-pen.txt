*printer_select_pen* -- Select a pen

  void printer_select_pen(resource printer_handle, resource pen_handle)~

The function selects a pen as the active drawing object of the actual device
context. A pen is used to draw lines and curves. I.e. if you draw a single
line the pen is used. If you draw an rectangle the pen is used to draw the
borders, while the brush is used to fill the shape. If you haven't selected a
pen before drawing shapes, the shape won't be outlined.

{printer_handle} {printer_handle} must be a valid printer handle.

{pen_handle} {pen_handle} must be a valid pen handle.

No value is returned.
