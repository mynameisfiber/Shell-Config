*pg_lo_import* -- Import a large object from file

  int pg_lo_import([resource connection, string pathname [, mixed object_id]])~

|pg_lo_import| creates a new large object in the database using a file on the
filesystem as its data source.

To use the large object interface, it is necessary to enclose it within a
transaction block.

When safe mode is enabled, PHP checks whether the files or directories being
operated upon have the same UID (owner) as the script that is being executed.

This function used to be called |pg_loimport|.

{connection} PostgreSQL database connection resource. When {connection} is not
present, the default connection is used. The default connection is the last
connection made by |pg_connect| or |pg_pconnect|.

{pathname} The full path and file name of the file on the client filesystem
from which to read the large object data.

{object_id} If an {object_id} is given the function will try to create a large
object with this id, else a free object id is assigned by the server. The
parameter was added in PHP 5.3 and relies on functionality that first appeared
in PostgreSQL 8.1.

The OID of the newly created large object, or FALSE on failure.

Version Description 5.3.0 The optional {object_id} was added.

  int pg_lo_import([resource connection, string pathname [, mixed object_id, string pathname [, resource connection]]])~
