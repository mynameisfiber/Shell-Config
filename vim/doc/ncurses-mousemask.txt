This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of

Sets mouse events to be reported. By default no mouse events will be reported.

Mouse events are represented by NCURSES_KEY_MOUSE in the |ncurses_wgetch|
input stream. To read the event data and pop the event of queue, call
|ncurses_getmouse|.

{newmask} Mouse mask options can be set with the following predefined
constants: NCURSES_BUTTON1_PRESSED

NCURSES_BUTTON1_RELEASED

NCURSES_BUTTON1_CLICKED

NCURSES_BUTTON1_DOUBLE_CLICKED

NCURSES_BUTTON1_TRIPLE_CLICKED

NCURSES_BUTTON2_PRESSED

NCURSES_BUTTON2_RELEASED

NCURSES_BUTTON2_CLICKED

NCURSES_BUTTON2_DOUBLE_CLICKED

NCURSES_BUTTON2_TRIPLE_CLICKED

NCURSES_BUTTON3_PRESSED

NCURSES_BUTTON3_RELEASED

NCURSES_BUTTON3_CLICKED

NCURSES_BUTTON3_DOUBLE_CLICKED

NCURSES_BUTTON3_TRIPLE_CLICKED

NCURSES_BUTTON4_RELEASED

NCURSES_BUTTON4_DOUBLE_CLICKED

NCURSES_BUTTON4_TRIPLE_CLICKED

NCURSES_BUTTON_SHIFT>

NCURSES_BUTTON_CTRL

NCURSES_BUTTON_ALT

NCURSES_ALL_MOUSE_EVENTS

NCURSES_REPORT_MOUSE_POSITION

As a side effect, setting a zero mousemask in {newmask} turns off the mouse
pointer. Setting a non zero value turns mouse pointer on.

{oldmask} This will be set to the previous value of the mouse event mask.

Returns a mask to indicated which of the in parameter {newmask} specified
mouse events can be reported. On complete failure, it returns 0.
