*pg_query* -- Execute a query

  resource pg_query([resource connection, string query])~

|pg_query| executes the {query} on the specified database {connection}.

If an error occurs, and FALSE is returned, details of the error can be
retrieved using the |pg_last_error| function if the connection is valid.

Although {connection} can be omitted, it is not recommended, since it can be
the cause of hard to find bugs in scripts.

This function used to be called |pg_exec|. |pg_exec| is still available for
compatibility reasons, but users are encouraged to use the newer name.

{connection} PostgreSQL database connection resource. When {connection} is not
present, the default connection is used. The default connection is the last
connection made by |pg_connect| or |pg_pconnect|.

{query} The SQL statement or statements to be executed. When multiple
statements are passed to the function, they are automatically executed as one
transaction, unless there are explicit BEGIN/COMMIT commands included in the
query string. However, using multiple transactions in one function call is not
recommended.

Data inside the query should be properly escaped.

A query result resource on success or FALSE on failure.

|pg_query| example

<?php >
  $conn = pg_pconnect("dbname=publisher");
  if (!$conn) {
    echo "An error occured.\n";
    exit;
  }
  
  $result = pg_query($conn, "SELECT author, email FROM authors");
  if (!$result) {
    echo "An error occured.\n";
    exit;
  }
  
  while ($row = pg_fetch_row($result)) {
    echo "Author: $row[0]  E-mail: $row[1]";
    echo "<br />\n";
  }
?>





Using |pg_query| with multiple statements

<?php >
  $conn = pg_pconnect("dbname=publisher");
  
  // these statements will be executed as one transaction
  
  $query = "UPDATE authors SET author=UPPER(author) WHERE id=1;";
  $query .= "UPDATE authors SET author=LOWER(author) WHERE id=2;";
  $query .= "UPDATE authors SET author=NULL WHERE id=3;";
  
  pg_query($conn, $query);
?>
