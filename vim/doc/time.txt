|time| example

<?php >
  $nextWeek = time() + (7 * 24 * 60 * 60);
                     // 7 days; 24 hours; 60 mins; 60secs
  echo 'Now:       '. date('Y-m-d') ."\n";
  echo 'Next Week: '. date('Y-m-d', $nextWeek) ."\n";
  // or using strtotime():
  echo 'Next Week: '. date('Y-m-d', strtotime('+1 week')) ."\n";
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Now:       2005-03-30
  Next Week: 2005-04-06
  Next Week: 2005-04-06
