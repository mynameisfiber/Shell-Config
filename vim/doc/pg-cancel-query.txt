    if (!pg_connection_busy($dbconn)) {
        pg_send_query($dbconn, "select * from authors; select count(*) from authors;");
    }
    
    $res1 = pg_get_result($dbconn);
    echo "First call to pg_get_result(): $res1\n";
    $rows1 = pg_num_rows($res1);
    echo "$res1 has $rows1 records\n\n";
