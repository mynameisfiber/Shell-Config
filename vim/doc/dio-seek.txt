*dio_seek* -- Seeks to pos on fd from whence

  int dio_seek(resource fd, int pos [, int whence])~

The function |dio_seek| is used to change the file position of the given file
descriptor.

{fd} The file descriptor returned by |dio_open|.

{pos} The new position.

{whence} Specifies how the position {pos} should be interpreted: SEEK_SET
(default) - specifies that {pos} is specified from the beginning of the file.

SEEK_CUR - Specifies that {pos} is a count of characters from the current file
position. This count may be positive or negative.

SEEK_END - Specifies that {pos} is a count of characters from the end of the
file. A negative count specifies a position within the current extent of the
file; a positive count specifies a position past the current end. If you set
the position past the current end, and actually write data, you will extend
the file with zeros up to that position.



Positioning in a file

<?php >
  $fd = dio_open('/dev/ttyS0', O_RDWR);
  
  dio_seek($fd, 10, SEEK_SET);
  // position is now at 10 characters from the start of the file
  
  dio_seek($fd, -2, SEEK_CUR);
  // position is now at 8 characters from the start of the file
  
  dio_seek($fd, -5, SEEK_END);
  // position is now at 5 characters from the end of the file
  
  dio_seek($fd, 10, SEEK_END);
  // position is now at 10 characters past the end of the file. 
  // The 10 characters between the end of the file and the current
  // position are filled with zeros.
  
  dio_close($fd);
?>
