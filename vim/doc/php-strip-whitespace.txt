*php_strip_whitespace* -- Return source with stripped comments and whitespace

  string php_strip_whitespace(string filename)~

Returns the PHP source code in {filename} with PHP comments and whitespace
removed. This may be useful for determining the amount of actual code in your
scripts compared with the amount of comments. This is similar to using php -w
from the commandline.

{filename} Path to the PHP file.

The stripped source code will be returned on success, or an empty string on
failure.

This function works as described as of PHP 5.0.1. Before this it would only
return an empty string. For more information on this bug and its prior
behavior, see bug report #29606.

|php_strip_whitespace| example

<?php >
  // PHP comment here
  
  /*
   * Another PHP comment
   */
  
  echo        php_strip_whitespace(__FILE__);
  // Newlines are considered whitespace, and are removed too:
  do_nothing();
?>

The above example will output:

<?php >
   echo php_strip_whitespace(__FILE__); do_nothing(); ?>

Notice the PHP comments are gone, as are the whitespace and newline after the
first echo statement.
