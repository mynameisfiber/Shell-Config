*oci_new_collection* -- Allocates new collection object

  OCI-Collection oci_new_collection(resource connection, string tdo [, string schema])~

Allocates a new collection object.

{connection} An Oracle connection identifier, returned by |oci_connect| or
|oci_pconnect|.

{tdo} Should be a valid named type (uppercase).

{schema} Should point to the scheme, where the named type was created. The
name of the current user is the default value.

Returns a new OCICollection object or FALSE on error.

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ocinewcollection| instead. This
name still can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_new_collection| for
downwards compatability. This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.
