*yaml_parse_url* -- Parse a Yaml stream from a URL

  mixed yaml_parse_url(string url [, int pos [, int ndocs [, array callbacks]]])~

Convert all or part of a YAML document stream read from a URL to a PHP
variable.

{url} {url} should be of the form "scheme://...". PHP will search for a
protocol handler (also known as a wrapper) for that scheme. If no wrappers for
that protocol are registered, PHP will emit a notice to help you track
potential problems in your script and then continue as though filename
specifies a regular file.

{pos} Document to extract from stream (-1 for all documents, 0 for first
document, ...).

{ndocs} If {ndocs} is provided, then it is filled with the number of documents
found in stream.

{callbacks} Content handlers for YAML nodes. Associative array of YAML tag =>
callback mappings.

Returns the value encoded in {input} in appropriate PHP type. NULL is returned
if the {input} cannot be decoded. If {pos} is -1 an array will be returned
with one entry for each document found in the stream.
