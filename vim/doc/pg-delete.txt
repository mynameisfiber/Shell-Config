*pg_delete* -- Deletes records

  mixed pg_delete(resource connection, string table_name, array assoc_array [, int options])~

|pg_delete| deletes records from a table specified by the keys and values in
{assoc_array}. If {options} is specified, |pg_convert| is applied to
{assoc_array} with the specified options.

{connection} PostgreSQL database connection resource.

{table_name} Name of the table from which to delete rows.

{assoc_array} An array whose keys are field names in the table {table_name},
and whose values are the values of those fields that are to be deleted.

{options} Any number of PGSQL_CONV_FORCE_NULL, PGSQL_DML_NO_CONV,
PGSQL_DML_EXEC or PGSQL_DML_STRING combined. If PGSQL_DML_STRING is part of
the {options} then query string is returned.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure. Returns string if
PGSQL_DML_STRING is passed via {options}.

|pg_delete| example

<?php >
    $db = pg_connect('dbname=foo');
    // This is safe, since $_POST is converted automatically
    $res = pg_delete($db, 'post_log', $_POST);
    if ($res) {
        echo "POST data is deleted: $res\n";
    } else {
        echo "User must have sent wrong inputs\n";
    }
?>
