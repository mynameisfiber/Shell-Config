*php_check_syntax* -- Check the PHP syntax of (and execute) the specified file

  bool php_check_syntax(string filename [, string error_message])~

Performs a syntax (lint) check on the specified {filename} testing for
scripting errors.

This is similar to using php -l from the commandline except that this function
will execute (but not output) the checked {filename}.

For example, if a function is defined in {filename}, this defined function
will be available to the file that executed |php_check_syntax|, but output
from {filename} will be suppressed.

For technical reasons, this function is deprecated and removed from PHP.
Instead, use php -l somefile.php from the commandline.

{filename} The name of the file being checked.

{error_message} If the {error_message} parameter is used, it will contain the
error message generated by the syntax check. {error_message} is passed by
reference.

Returns TRUE if the lint check passed, and FALSE if the link check failed or
if {filename} cannot be opened.

Version Description 5.0.5 This function was removed from PHP. 5.0.3 Calling
|exit| after |php_check_syntax| resulted in a Segfault. 5.0.1 {error_message}
is passed by reference.

  php -l somefile.php

The above example will output something similar to:

  PHP Parse error: unexpected T_STRING in /tmp/somefile.php on line 81

|include| |is_readable|
