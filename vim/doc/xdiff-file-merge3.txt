*xdiff_file_merge3* -- Merge 3 files into one

  mixed xdiff_file_merge3(string old_file, string new_file1, string new_file2, string dest)~

Merges three files into one and stores the result in a file {dest}. The
{old_file} is an original version while {new_file1} and {new_file2} are
modified versions of an original.

{old_file} Path to the first file. It acts as "old" file.

{new_file1} Path to the second file. It acts as modified version of
{old_file}.

{new_file2} Path to the third file. It acts as modified version of {old_file}.

{dest} Path of the resulting file, containing merged changed from both
{new_file1} and {new_file2}.

Returns TRUE if merge was successful, string with rejected chunks if it was
not or FALSE if an internal error happened.

<?php >
  $old_version = 'original_script.php';

  $fix2 = 'script_with_fix2.php';
  
  $errors = xdiff_file_merge3($old_version, $fix1, $fix2, 'fixed_script.php');
  if (is_string($errors)) {
      echo "Rejects:\n";
