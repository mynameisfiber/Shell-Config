*openssl_pkcs7_encrypt* -- Encrypt an S/MIME message

  bool openssl_pkcs7_encrypt(string infile, string outfile, mixed recipcerts, array headers [, int flags [, int cipherid]])~

|openssl_pkcs7_encrypt| takes the contents of the file named {infile} and
encrypts them using an RC2 40-bit cipher so that they can only be read by the
intended recipients specified by {recipcerts}.

{infile}

{outfile}

{recipcerts} Either a lone X.509 certificate, or an array of X.509
certificates.

{headers} {headers} is an array of headers that will be prepended to the data
after it has been encrypted.

{headers} can be either an associative array keyed by header name, or an
indexed array, where each element contains a single header line.

{flags} {flags} can be used to specify options that affect the encoding
process - see PKCS7 constants.

{cipherid} Cipher can be selected with {cipherid}.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

Version Description 5.0.0 The {cipherid} parameter was added.
