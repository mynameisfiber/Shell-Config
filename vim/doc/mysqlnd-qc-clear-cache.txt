*mysqlnd_qc_clear_cache* -- Flush all cache contents

  bool mysqlnd_qc_clear_cache()~

Flush all cache contents.

Flushing the cache is a storage handler responsibility. All built-in storage
handler but the memcache storage handler support flushing the cache. The
memcache storage handler cannot flush its cache contents.

User-defined storage handler may or may not support the operation.

This function has no parameters.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

A return value of FALSE indicates that flushing all cache contents has failed
or the operation is not supported by the active storage handler. Applications
must not expect that calling the function will always flush the cache.
