*gmp_init* -- Create GMP number

  resource gmp_init(mixed number [, int base])~

Creates a GMP number from an integer or string.

{number} An integer or a string. The string representation can be decimal,
hexadecimal or octal.

{base} The base.

The base may vary from 2 to 36. If base is 0 (default value), the actual base
is determined from the leading characters: if the first two characters are 0x
or 0X, hexadecimal is assumed, otherwise if the first character is "0", octal
is assumed, otherwise decimal is assumed.

A GMP number resource.

Version Description 5.3.2 The {base} was extended from 2 to 36, to 2 to 62 and
-2 to -36. 4.1.0 The optional {base} parameter was added.

To use the extended base introduced in PHP 5.3.2, then PHP must be compiled
against GMP 4.2.0 or greater.

Creating GMP number

<?php >
  $a = gmp_init(123456);
  $b = gmp_init("0xFFFFDEBACDFEDF7200");
?>





It is not necessary to call this function if you want to use integer or string
in place of GMP number in GMP functions, like |gmp_add|. Function arguments
are automatically converted to GMP numbers, if such conversion is possible and
needed, using the same rules as |gmp_init|.
