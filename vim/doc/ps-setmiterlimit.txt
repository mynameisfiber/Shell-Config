*ps_setmiterlimit* -- Sets the miter limit

  bool ps_setmiterlimit(resource psdoc, float value)~

If two lines join in a small angle and the line join is set to
PS_LINEJOIN_MITER, then the resulting spike will be very long. The miter limit
is the maximum ratio of the miter length (the length of the spike) and the
line width.

{psdoc} Resource identifier of the postscript file as returned by |ps_new|.

{value} The maximum ratio between the miter length and the line width. Larger
values (> 10) will result in very long spikes when two lines meet in a small
angle. Keep the default unless you know what you are doing.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.
