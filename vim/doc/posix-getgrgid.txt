*posix_getgrgid* -- Return info about a group by group id

  array posix_getgrgid(int gid)~

Gets information about a group provided its id.

{gid} The group id.

The array elements returned are: The group information array Element
Description name The name element contains the name of the group. This is a
short, usually less than 16 character "handle" of the group, not the real,
full name. passwd The passwd element contains the group's password in an
encrypted format. Often, for example on a system employing "shadow" passwords,
an asterisk is returned instead. gid Group ID, should be the same as the {gid}
parameter used when calling the function, and hence redundant. members This
consists of an array of string's for all the members in the group.

Version Description 4.2.0 Prior to this version, members was simply an integer
representing the number of members in the group, and the member names were
returned with numerical indices.

Example use of |posix_getgrgid|

<?php >
  $groupid   = posix_getegid();
  $groupinfo = posix_getgrgid($groupid);
  
  print_r($groupinfo);
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Array
  (
      [name]    => toons
      [passwd]  => x
      [members] => Array
          (
              [0] => tom
              [1] => jerry
          )
      [gid]     => 42
  )
