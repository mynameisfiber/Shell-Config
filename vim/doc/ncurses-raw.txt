*ncurses_raw* -- Switch terminal into raw mode

  bool ncurses_raw()~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

Places the terminal in raw mode. Raw mode is similar to cbreak mode, in that
characters typed are immediately passed through to the user program. The
differences that are that in raw mode, the interrupt, quit, suspend and flow
control characters are all passed through uninterpreted, instead of generating
a signal.

Returns TRUE if any error occurred, otherwise FALSE.
