*ps_set_info* -- Sets information fields of document

  bool ps_set_info(resource p, string key, string val)~

Sets certain information fields of the document. This fields will be shown as
a comment in the header of the PostScript file. If the document is converted
to pdf this fields will also be used for the document information.

The BoundingBox is usually set to the value given to the first page. This only
works if |ps_findfont| has not been called before. In such cases the
BoundingBox would be left unset unless you set it explicitly with this
function.

This function will have no effect anymore when the header of the postscript
file has been already written. It must be called before the first page or the
first call of |ps_findfont|.

{psdoc} Resource identifier of the postscript file as returned by |ps_new|.

{key} The name of the information field to set. The values which can be set
are Keywords, Subject, Title, Creator, Author, BoundingBox, and Orientation.
Be aware that some of them has a meaning to PostScript viewers.

{value} The value of the information field. The field Orientation can be set
to either Portrait or Landscape. The BoundingBox is a string consisting of
four numbers. The first two numbers are the coordinates of the lower left
corner of the page. The last two numbers are the coordinates of the upper
right corner.

Up to version 0.2.6 of pslib, the BoundingBox and Orientation will be
overwritten by |ps_begin_page|, unless |ps_findfont| has been called before.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

|ps_findfont| |ps_begin_page|
