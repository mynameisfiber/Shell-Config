*SDO_DAS_Setting::getValue* -- Get the old value for the changed property

  mixed SDO_DAS_Setting::getValue()~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

Returns the old value for the changed property. This can be used by a Data
Access Service when writing updates to a data source. The DAS uses the old
value to detect conflicts by comparing it with the current value in the data
source. If they do not match, then the data source has been updated since the
data object was originally populated, and therefore writing any new updates
risks compromising the integrity of the data.

None.

Returns the old value of the changed property.
