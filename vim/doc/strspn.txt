*strspn* -- Finds the length of the first segment of a string consisting
entirely of characters contained within a given mask.

  int strspn(string subject, string mask [, int start [, int length]])~

Returns the length of the first group of consecutive characters from {mask}
found in {subject}.

If {start} and {length} are omitted, then all of {subject} will be examined.
If they are included, then the effect will be the same as calling
strspn(substr($subject, $start, $length), $mask) (see for more information).

The line of code:

<?php >
  $var = strspn("42 is the answer to the 128th question.", "1234567890");
?>

will assign 2 to $var, because the string "42" is the first segment from
{subject} to consist only of characters contained within "1234567890".

{subject} The string to examine.

{mask} The list of allowable characters to include in counted segments.

{start} The position in {subject} to start searching.

If {start} is given and is non-negative, then |strspn| will begin examining
{subject} at the {start}'th position. For instance, in the string 'abcdef',
the character at position 0 is 'a', the character at position 2 is 'c', and so
forth.

If {start} is given and is negative, then |strspn| will begin examining
{subject} at the {start}'th position from the end of {subject}.

{length} The length of the segment from {subject} to examine.

If {length} is given and is non-negative, then {subject} will be examined for
{length} characters after the starting position.

If {length}is given and is negative, then {subject} will be examined from the
starting position up to {length} characters from the end of {subject}.

Returns the length of the initial segment of {str1} which consists entirely of
characters in {str2}.

Version Description 4.3.0 The {start} and {length} parameters were added
