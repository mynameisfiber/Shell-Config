*rpm_is_valid* -- Tests a filename for validity as an RPM file

  bool rpm_is_valid(string filename)~

|rpm_is_valid| will test an RPM file for validity as an RPM file. This is not
the same as |rpm_open| as it only checks the file for validity but does not
return a file pointer to be used by further functions.

{filename} The filename of the RPM file you wish to check for validity.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

|rpm_is_valid| example

<?php >
  $file = "/path/to/file.rpm";
  
  if (rpm_is_valid($file)) {
      echo "File is recognized as an RPM file.<br>\n";
  }
  else {
      echo "File is not recognized as an RPM file.<br>\n";
  }
?>
