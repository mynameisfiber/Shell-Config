*pg_connect* -- Open a PostgreSQL connection

  resource pg_connect(string connection_string [, int connect_type])~

|pg_connect| opens a connection to a PostgreSQL database specified by the
{connection_string}.

If a second call is made to |pg_connect| with the same {connection_string} as
an existing connection, the existing connection will be returned unless you
pass PGSQL_CONNECT_FORCE_NEW as {connect_type}.

The old syntax with multiple parameters $conn = pg_connect("host", "port",
"options", "tty", "dbname") has been deprecated.

{connection_string} The {connection_string} can be empty to use all default
parameters, or it can contain one or more parameter settings separated by
whitespace. Each parameter setting is in the form keyword = value. Spaces
around the equal sign are optional. To write an empty value or a value
containing spaces, surround it with single quotes, e.g., keyword = 'a value'.
Single quotes and backslashes within the value must be escaped with a
backslash, i.e., \' and \\.

The currently recognized parameter keywords are: {host}, {hostaddr}, {port},
{dbname} (defaults to value of {user}), {user}, {password}, {connect_timeout},
{options}, {tty} (ignored), {sslmode}, {requiressl} (deprecated in favor of
{sslmode}), and {service}. Which of these arguments exist depends on your
PostgreSQL version.

The {options} parameter can be used to set command line parameters to be
invoked by the server.

{connect_type} If PGSQL_CONNECT_FORCE_NEW is passed, then a new connection is
created, even if the {connection_string} is identical to an existing
connection.

PostgreSQL connection resource on success, FALSE on failure.

Using |pg_connect|

<?php >
  $dbconn = pg_connect("dbname=mary");
  //connect to a database named "mary"
  
  $dbconn2 = pg_connect("host=localhost port=5432 dbname=mary");
  // connect to a database named "mary" on "localhost" at port "5432"
  
  $dbconn3 = pg_connect("host=sheep port=5432 dbname=mary user=lamb password=foo");
  //connect to a database named "mary" on the host "sheep" with a username and password
  
  $conn_string = "host=sheep port=5432 dbname=test user=lamb password=bar";
  $dbconn4 = pg_connect($conn_string);
  //connect to a database named "test" on the host "sheep" with a username and password
  
  $dbconn5 = pg_connect("host=localhost options='--client_encoding=UTF8'");
  //connect to a database on "localhost" and set the command line parameter which tells the encoding is in UTF-8
