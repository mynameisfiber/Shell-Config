*ps_setcolor* -- Sets current color

  bool ps_setcolor(resource psdoc, string type, string colorspace, float c1, float c2, float c3, float c4)~

Sets the color for drawing, filling, or both.

{psdoc} Resource identifier of the postscript file as returned by |ps_new|.

{type} The parameter {type} can be both, fill, or fillstroke.

{colorspace} The colorspace should be one of gray, rgb, cmyk, spot, pattern.
Depending on the colorspace either only the first, the first three or all
parameters will be used.

{c1} Depending on the colorspace this is either the red component (rgb), the
cyan component (cmyk), the gray value (gray), the identifier of the spot color
or the identifier of the pattern.

{c2} Depending on the colorspace this is either the green component (rgb), the
magenta component (cmyk).

{c3} Depending on the colorspace this is either the blue component (rgb), the
yellow component (cmyk).

{c4} This must only be set in cmyk colorspace and specifies the black
component.

The second parameter is currently not always evaluated. The color is sometimes
set for filling and drawing just as if fillstroke were passed.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.
