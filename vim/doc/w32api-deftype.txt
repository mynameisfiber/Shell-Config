*w32api_deftype* -- Defines a type for use with other w32api_functions

  bool w32api_deftype(string typename, string member1_type, string member1_name [, string ... [, string ...]])~

You need to call this function if you would like to define a type for a w32api
call.

{typename} The name of the type.

{member1_type} A member type can be a user defined type. All the type names
are case sensitive. Built in type names should be provided in lowercase.

{member1_name} The member name of {member1_type}.

{...}

{...}

This function takes 2n+1 arguments, where n is the number of members the type
has. After that is the type of the member followed by the members name (in
pairs).

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.
