*mb_strpos* -- Find position of first occurrence of string in a string

  int mb_strpos(string haystack, string needle [, int offset [, string encoding]])~

Finds position of the first occurrence of a string in a string.

Performs a multi-byte safe |strpos| operation based on number of characters.
The first character's position is 0, the second character position is 1, and
so on.

{haystack} The string being checked.

{needle} The string to find in {haystack}. In contrast with |strpos|, numeric
values are not applied as the ordinal value of a character.

{offset} The search offset. If it is not specified, 0 is used.

{encoding} The {encoding} parameter is the character encoding. If it is
omitted, the internal character encoding value will be used.

Returns the numeric position of the first occurrence of {needle} in the
{haystack} string. If {needle} is not found, it returns FALSE.

|mb_internal_encoding| |strpos|
