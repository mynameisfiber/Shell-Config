*SCA_LocalProxy::createDataObject* -- create an SDO

  SDO_DataObject SCA_LocalProxy::createDataObject(string type_namespace_uri, string type_name)~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

This method is used inside either an ordinary PHP script or an SCA component
that needs to create an SDO to pass to a local service. The parameters are the
desired SDO's namespace URI and type name. The namespace and type must be
defined in the interface of the component that is to be called, so the
namespace and type must be defined in one of the schema files which are
specified on the @types annotation within the component for which the
SCA_LocalProxy object is a proxy.

{type_namespace_uri} The namespace of the type.

{type_name} The name of the type.

Returns the newly created SDO_DataObject.

{SDO_TypeNotFoundException} Thrown if the namespaceURI and typeName do not
correspond to a type in any of the schema files specified in the @types
annotations within the component for which the SCA_LocalProxy object is a
proxy..
