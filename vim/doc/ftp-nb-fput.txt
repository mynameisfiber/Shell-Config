*ftp_nb_fput* -- Stores a file from an open file to the FTP server
(non-blocking)

  int ftp_nb_fput(resource ftp_stream, string remote_file, resource handle, int mode [, int startpos])~

|ftp_nb_fput| uploads the data from a file pointer to a remote file on the FTP
server.

The difference between this function and the |ftp_fput| is that this function
uploads the file asynchronously, so your program can perform other operations
while the file is being uploaded.

{ftp_stream} The link identifier of the FTP connection.

{remote_file} The remote file path.

{handle} An open file pointer on the local file. Reading stops at end of file.

{mode} The transfer mode. Must be either FTP_ASCII or FTP_BINARY.

{startpos} The position in the remote file to start uploading to.

Returns FTP_FAILED or FTP_FINISHED or FTP_MOREDATA.

  $fp = fopen($file, 'r');
  
  $conn_id = ftp_connect($ftp_server);
  
  $login_result = ftp_login($conn_id, $ftp_user_name, $ftp_user_pass);
  
  // Initate the upload
  $ret = ftp_nb_fput($conn_id, $file, $fp, FTP_BINARY);
  while ($ret == FTP_MOREDATA) {
  
     // Do whatever you want
     echo ".";
  
     // Continue upload...
     $ret = ftp_nb_continue($conn_id);
  }
  if ($ret != FTP_FINISHED) {
     echo "There was an error uploading the file...";
     exit(1);
  }
  
  fclose($fp);
