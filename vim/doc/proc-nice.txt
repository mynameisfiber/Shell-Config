*proc_nice* -- Change the priority of the current process

  bool proc_nice(int increment)~

|proc_nice| changes the priority of the current process by the amount
specified in {increment}. A positive {increment} will lower the priority of
the current process, whereas a negative {increment} will raise the priority.

|proc_nice| is not related to |proc_open| and its associated functions in any
way.

{increment} The increment value of the priority change.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure. If an error occurs, like the
user lacks permission to change the priority, an error of level E_WARNING is
also generated.
