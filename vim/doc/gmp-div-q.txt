Divides {a} by {b} and returns the integer result.

{a} The number being divided.

It can be either a GMP number resource, or a numeric string given that it is
possible to convert the latter to a number.

{b} The number that {a} is being divided by.

It can be either a GMP number resource, or a numeric string given that it is
possible to convert the latter to a number.

{round} The result rounding is defined by the {round}, which can have the
following values: GMP_ROUND_ZERO: The result is truncated towards 0.

GMP_ROUND_PLUSINF: The result is rounded towards +infinity.

GMP_ROUND_MINUSINF: The result is rounded towards -infinity.

It can be either a GMP number resource, or a numeric string given that it is
possible to convert the latter to a number.

A GMP number resource.

|gmp_div_q| example

<?php >
  $div1 = gmp_div_q("100", "5");
  echo gmp_strval($div1) . "\n";
  
  $div2 = gmp_div_q("1", "3");
  echo gmp_strval($div2) . "\n";
  
  $div3 = gmp_div_q("1", "3", GMP_ROUND_PLUSINF);
  echo gmp_strval($div3) . "\n";
  
  $div4 = gmp_div_q("-1", "4", GMP_ROUND_PLUSINF);
  echo gmp_strval($div4) . "\n";
  
  $div5 = gmp_div_q("-1", "4", GMP_ROUND_MINUSINF);
  echo gmp_strval($div5) . "\n";
?>

The above example will output:

  20
  0
  1
  0
  -1
