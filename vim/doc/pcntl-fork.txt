*pcntl_fork* -- Forks the currently running process

  int pcntl_fork()~

The |pcntl_fork| function creates a child process that differs from the parent
process only in its PID and PPID. Please see your system's fork(2) man page
for specific details as to how fork works on your system.

On success, the PID of the child process is returned in the parent's thread of
execution, and a 0 is returned in the child's thread of execution. On failure,
a -1 will be returned in the parent's context, no child process will be
created, and a PHP error is raised.

|pcntl_fork| example

<?php >
  $pid = pcntl_fork();
  if ($pid == -1) {
       die('could not fork');
  } else if ($pid) {
       // we are the parent
       pcntl_wait($status); //Protect against Zombie children
  } else {
       // we are the child
  }
?>
