|is_a| example

<?php >
  // define a class
  class WidgetFactory
  {
    var $oink = 'moo';
  }
  
  // create a new object
  $WF = new WidgetFactory();
  
  if (is_a($WF, 'WidgetFactory')) {
    echo "yes, \$WF is still a WidgetFactory\n";
  }

<?php >
  if ($WF instanceof WidgetFactory) {
      echo 'Yes, $WF is a WidgetFactory';
  }
?>
