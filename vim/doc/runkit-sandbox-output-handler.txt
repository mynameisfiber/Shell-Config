*runkit_sandbox_output_handler* -- Specify a function to capture and/or process
output from a runkit sandbox

  mixed runkit_sandbox_output_handler(object sandbox [, mixed callback])~

Ordinarily, anything output (such as with |echo| or |print|) will be output as
though it were printed from the parent's scope. Using
|runkit_sandbox_output_handler| however, output generated by the sandbox
(including errors), can be captured by a function outside of the sandbox.

Sandbox support (required for |runkit_lint|, |runkit_lint_file|, and the
Runkit_Sandbox class) is only available as of PHP 5.1.0 or specially patched
versions of PHP 5.0, and requires that thread safety be enabled. See the
README file included in the runkit package for more information.

As of runkit version 0.5, this function is deprecated and is scheduled to be
removed from the package prior to a 1.0 release. The output handler for a
given Runkit_Sandbox instance may be read/set using the array offset syntax
shown on the Runkit_Sandbox class definition page.

{sandbox} Object instance of Runkit_Sandbox class on which to set output
handling.

{callback} Name of a function which expects one parameter. Output generated by
{sandbox} will be passed to this callback. Anything returned by the callback
will be displayed normally. If this parameter is not passed then output
handling will not be changed. If a non-truth value is passed, output handling
will be disabled and will revert to direct display.

Returns the name of the previously defined output handler callback, or FALSE
if no handler was previously defined.

Feeding output to a variable

<?php >
  function capture_output($str) {
    $GLOBALS['sandbox_output'] .= $str;
  
    return '';
  }
  
  $sandbox_output = '';
  
  $php = new Runkit_Sandbox();
  runkit_sandbox_output_handler($php, 'capture_output');
  $php->echo("Hello\n");
  $php->eval('var_dump("Excuse me");');
  $php->die("I lost myself.");
  unset($php);
  
  echo "Sandbox Complete\n\n";
  echo $sandbox_output;
?>

The above example will output:

  Sandbox Complete
  
  Hello
  string(9) "Excuse me"
  I lost myself.
