*openssl_pkcs7_sign* -- Sign an S/MIME message

  bool openssl_pkcs7_sign(string infilename, string outfilename, mixed signcert, mixed privkey, array headers [, int flags [, string extracerts]])~

|openssl_pkcs7_sign| takes the contents of the file named {infilename} and
signs them using the certificate and its matching private key specified by
{signcert} and {privkey} parameters.

{infilename}

{outfilename}

{signcert}

{privkey}

{headers} {headers} is an array of headers that will be prepended to the data
after it has been signed (see |openssl_pkcs7_encrypt| for more information
about the format of this parameter).

{flags} {flags} can be used to alter the output - see PKCS7 constants.

{extracerts} {extracerts} specifies the name of a file containing a bunch of
extra certificates to include in the signature which can for example be used
to help the recipient to verify the certificate that you used.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.
