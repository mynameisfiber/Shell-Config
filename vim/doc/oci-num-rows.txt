This function does not return number of rows selected! For SELECT statements
this function will return the number of rows, that were fetched to the buffer
with |oci_fetch*| functions.

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ocirowcount| instead. This name
still can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_num_rows| for downwards
compatability. This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.
