*pg_get_result* -- Get asynchronous query result

  resource pg_get_result([resource connection])~

|pg_get_result| gets the result resource from an asynchronous query executed
by |pg_send_query|, |pg_send_query_params| or |pg_send_execute|.

|pg_send_query| and the other asynchronous query functions can send multiple
queries to a PostgreSQL server and |pg_get_result| is used to get each query's
results, one by one.

{connection} PostgreSQL database connection resource.

The result resource, or FALSE if no more results are available.

|pg_get_result| example

<?php >
    $dbconn = pg_connect("dbname=publisher") or die("Could not connect");
  
    if (!pg_connection_busy($dbconn)) {
        pg_send_query($dbconn, "select * from authors; select count(*) from authors;");
    }
    
    $res1 = pg_get_result($dbconn);
    echo "First call to pg_get_result(): $res1\n";
    $rows1 = pg_num_rows($res1);
    echo "$res1 has $rows1 records\n\n";
    
    $res2 = pg_get_result($dbconn);
    echo "Second call to pg_get_result(): $res2\n";
    $rows2 = pg_num_rows($res2);
    echo "$res2 has $rows2 records\n";
?>

The above example will output:

  First call to pg_get_result(): Resource id #3
  Resource id #3 has 3 records
  
  Second call to pg_get_result(): Resource id #4
  Resource id #4 has 1 records
