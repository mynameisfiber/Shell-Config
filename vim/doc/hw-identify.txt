*hw_Identify* -- Identifies as user

  string hw_identify(int link, string username, string password)~

Identifies as user with {username} and {password}. Identification is only
valid for the current session. I do not think this function will be needed
very often. In most cases it will be easier to identify with the opening of
the connection.

{link} The connection identifier.

{username} The username.

{password} The password.
