*utf8_encode* -- Encodes an ISO-8859-1 string to UTF-8

  string utf8_encode(string data)~

This function encodes the string {data} to UTF-8, and returns the encoded
version. UTF-8 is a standard mechanism used by Unicode for encoding wide
character values into a byte stream. UTF-8 is transparent to plain ASCII
characters, is self-synchronized (meaning it is possible for a program to
figure out where in the bytestream characters start) and can be used with
normal string comparison functions for sorting and such. PHP encodes UTF-8
characters in up to four bytes, like this: UTF-8 encoding bytes bits

10bbbbbb 4 21 11110bbb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb Each b represents a bit that
can be used to store character data.
