*fnmatch* -- Match filename against a pattern

  bool fnmatch(string pattern, string string [, int flags])~

|fnmatch| checks if the passed {string} would match the given shell wildcard
{pattern}.

{pattern} The shell wildcard pattern.

{string} The tested string. This function is especially useful for filenames,
but may also be used on regular strings.

The average user may be used to shell patterns or at least in their simplest
form to '?' and '*' wildcards so using |fnmatch| instead of |preg_match| for
frontend search expression input may be way more convenient for
non-programming users.

{flags} The value of {flags} can be any combination of the following flags,
joined with the binary OR (|) operator. A list of possible flags for |fnmatch|
{Flag} Description FNM_NOESCAPE Disable backslash escaping. FNM_PATHNAME Slash
in string only matches slash in the given pattern. FNM_PERIOD Leading period
in string must be exactly matched by period in the given pattern. FNM_CASEFOLD
Caseless match. Part of the GNU extension.

Returns TRUE if there is a match, FALSE otherwise.

Version Description 5.3.0 This function is now available on Windows platforms.
