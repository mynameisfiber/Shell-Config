*px_put_record* -- Stores record into paradox database

  bool px_put_record(resource pxdoc, array record [, int recpos])~

Stores a record into a paradox database. The record is always added at the end
of the database, regardless of any free slots. Use |px_insert_record| to add a
new record into the first free slot found in the database.

{pxdoc} Resource identifier of the paradox database as returned by |px_new|.

{record} Associated or indexed array containing the field values as e.g.
returned by |px_retrieve_record|.

{recpos} This optional parameter may be used to specify a record number
greater than the current number of records in the database. The function will
add as many empty records as needed. There is hardly any need for this
parameter.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.
