*ps_rect* -- Draws a rectangle

  bool ps_rect(resource psdoc, float x, float y, float width, float height)~

rectangle as a subpath. If the last drawing operation does not end in the
lower left corner then there will be a gap in the path.

{x} x-coordinate of the lower left corner of the rectangle.

{y} y-coordinate of the lower left corner of the rectangle.
