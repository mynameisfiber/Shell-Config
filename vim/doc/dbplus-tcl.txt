*dbplus_tcl* -- Execute TCL code on server side

  string dbplus_tcl(int sid, string script)~

A db++ server will prepare a TCL interpreter for each client connection. This
interpreter will enable the server to execute TCL code provided by the client
as a sort of stored procedures to improve the performance of database
operations by avoiding client/server data transfers and context switches.

|dbplus_tcl| needs to pass the client connection id the TCL {script} code
should be executed by. |dbplus_resolve| will provide this connection id. The
function will return whatever the TCL code returns or a TCL error message if
the TCL code fails.

{sid}

{script}
