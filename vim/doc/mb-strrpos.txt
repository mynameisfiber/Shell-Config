*mb_strrpos* -- Find position of last occurrence of a string in a string

  int mb_strrpos(string haystack, string needle [, int offset [, string encoding]])~

Performs a multibyte safe |strrpos| operation based on the number of
characters. {needle} position is counted from the beginning of {haystack}.
First character's position is 0. Second character position is 1.

{haystack} The string being checked, for the last occurrence of {needle}

{needle} The string to find in {haystack}.

{offset} May be specified to begin searching an arbitrary number of characters
into the string. Negative values will stop searching at an arbitrary point
prior to the end of the string.

{encoding} The {encoding} parameter is the character encoding. If it is
omitted, the internal character encoding value will be used.

Returns the numeric position of the last occurrence of {needle} in the
{haystack} string. If {needle} is not found, it returns FALSE.

Version Description 5.2.0 Added the optional parameter {offset}.

The {encoding} parameter was moved from the third position to the fourth in
PHP 5.2.0. For backward compatibility, {encoding} can be specified as the
third parameter, but doing so is deprecated and will be removed in the future.

The internal encoding or the character encoding specified by
|mb_regex_encoding| will be used as the character encoding for this function.
