*oci_set_client_info* -- Sets the client information

  bool oci_set_client_info(resource connection, string client_info)~

Sets the client information for Oracle tracing.

The client information is registered with the database when the next
'roundtrip' from PHP to the database occurs, typically when an SQL statement
is executed.

The client information can subsequently be queried from database
administration views such as V$SESSION.

The value may be retained across persistent connections.

{} An Oracle connection identifier, returned by |oci_connect|, |oci_pconnect|,
or |oci_new_connect|.

{} User chosen string up to 64 bytes long.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

Setting the client information

<?php >
  $c = oci_connect('hr', 'welcome', 'localhost/XE');
  
  // Record the client information
  oci_set_client_info($c, 'My Application Version 2');
  
  // Code that causes a roundtrip, for example a query:
  $s = oci_parse($c, 'select * from dual');
  oci_execute($s);
  oci_fetch_all($s, $res);
  
  sleep(30);
?>

  // While the script is running, the administrator can see the client
  // information:
  
  sqlplus system/welcome
  SQL> select client_info from v$session;



This function is available when PHP is linked with Oracle Database libraries
from version 10g onwards.

With older versions of OCI8 or the Oracle Database, the client information can
be set using the Oracle DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO package. This is less efficient
than using |oci_set_client_info|.

Some but not all OCI8 functions cause roundtrips. Roundtrips to the database
may not occur with queries when result caching is enabled.
