*xdiff_string_rabdiff* -- Make binary diff of two strings using the Rabin's
polynomial fingerprinting algorithm

  string xdiff_string_bdiff(string old_data, string new_data)~

Makes a binary diff of two strings and returns the result. The difference
between this function and |xdiff_string_bdiff| is different algorithm used
which should result in faster execution and smaller diff produced. This
function works with both text and binary data. Resulting patch can be later
applied using |xdiff_string_bpatch|/|xdiff_file_bpatch|.

For more details about differences between algorithm used please check
libxdiff website.

{old_data} First string with binary data. It acts as "old" data.

{new_data} Second string with binary data. It acts as "new" data.

Returns string with binary diff containing differences between "old" and "new"
data or FALSE if an internal error occurred.
