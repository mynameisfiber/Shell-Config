*event_set* -- Prepare an event

  bool event_set(resource event, mixed fd, int events, mixed callback [, mixed arg])~

Prepares the event to be used in |event_add|. The event is prepared to call
the function specified by the {callback} on the events specified in parameter
{events}, which is a set of the following flags: EV_TIMEOUT, EV_SIGNAL,
EV_READ, EV_WRITE, EV_PERSIST and EV_SIGNAL.

If EV_SIGNAL bit is set in parameter {events}, the {fd} is interpreted as
signal number.

After initializing the event, use |event_base_set| to associate the event with
its event base.

In case of matching event, these three arguments are passed to the {callback}
function: {fd} Signal number or resource indicating the stream.

{events} A flag indicating the event. Consists of the following flags:
EV_TIMEOUT, EV_SIGNAL, EV_READ, EV_WRITE, EV_PERSIST and EV_SIGNAL.

{arg} Optional parameter, previously passed to |event_set| as {arg}.

{event} Valid event resource.

{fd} Valid PHP stream resource. The stream must be castable to file
descriptor, so you most likely won't be able to use any of filtered streams.

{events} A set of flags indicating the desired event, can be EV_READ and/or
EV_WRITE. The additional flag EV_PERSIST makes the event to persist until
|event_del| is called, otherwise the callback is invoked only once.

{callback} Callback function to be called when the matching event occurs.

{arg} Optional callback parameter.

|event_set| returns TRUE on success or FALSE on error.
