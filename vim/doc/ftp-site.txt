  bool ftp_site(resource ftp_stream, string command)~

may be some issues with filenames containing spaces and other characters.

  // Login as "user" with password "pass"
  if (!ftp_login($conn, 'user', 'pass')) die('Error logging into ftp.example.com');
  
  // Issue: "SITE CHMOD 0600 /home/user/privatefile" command to ftp server
  if (ftp_site($conn, 'CHMOD 0600 /home/user/privatefile')) {
     echo "Command executed successfully.\n";
