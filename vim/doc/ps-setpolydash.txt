Drawing a dashed line

<?php >
  $ps = ps_new();
  if (!ps_open_file($ps, "polydash.ps")) {
     print "Cannot open PostScript file\n";
       exit;
  }
  
  ps_set_info($ps, "Creator", "polydash.php");
  ps_set_info($ps, "Author", "Uwe Steinmann");
  ps_set_info($ps, "Title", "Poly dash example");
  
  ps_begin_page($ps, 596, 842);
  ps_setpolydash($ps, array(10, 5, 2, 5));
  ps_moveto($ps, 100, 100);
  ps_lineto($ps, 200, 200);
  ps_stroke($ps);
  ps_end_page($ps);
  
  ps_delete($ps);
?>
