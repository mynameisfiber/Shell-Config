*flush* -- Flush the output buffer

  void flush()~

Flushes the write buffers of PHP and whatever backend PHP is using (CGI, a web
server, etc). This attempts to push current output all the way to the browser
with a few caveats.

|flush| may not be able to override the buffering scheme of your web server
and it has no effect on any client-side buffering in the browser. It also
doesn't affect PHP's userspace output buffering mechanism. This means you will
have to call both |ob_flush| and |flush| to flush the ob output buffers if you
are using those.

Several servers, especially on Win32, will still buffer the output from your
script until it terminates before transmitting the results to the browser.

Server modules for Apache like mod_gzip may do buffering of their own that
will cause |flush| to not result in data being sent immediately to the client.
