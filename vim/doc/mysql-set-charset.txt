*mysql_set_charset* -- Sets the client character set

  bool mysql_set_charset(string charset [, resource link_identifier])~

Sets the default character set for the current connection.

{charset} A valid character set name.

{ link_identifier}The MySQL connection. If the link identifier is not
specified, the last link opened by |mysql_connect| is assumed. If no such link
is found, it will try to create one as if |mysql_connect| was called with no
arguments. If no connection is found or established, an E_WARNING level error
is generated.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

This function requires MySQL 5.0.7 or later.

This is the preferred way to change the charset. Using |mysql_query| to
execute SET NAMES .. is not recommended.

|mysql_client_encoding| List of character sets that MySQL supports
