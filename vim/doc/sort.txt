*sort* -- Sort an array

  bool sort(array array [, int sort_flags])~

This function sorts an array. Elements will be arranged from lowest to highest
when this function has completed.

{array} The input array.

{sort_flags} The optional second parameter {sort_flags} may be used to modify
the sorting behavior using these values:

Sorting type flags: SORT_REGULAR - compare items normally (don't change types)

SORT_NUMERIC - compare items numerically

SORT_STRING - compare items as strings

SORT_LOCALE_STRING - compare items as strings, based on the current locale.
Added in PHP 4.4.0 and 5.0.2, it uses the system locale, which can be changed
using |setlocale|.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

|sort| example

<?php >
  $fruits = array("lemon", "orange", "banana", "apple");
  sort($fruits);
  foreach ($fruits as $key => $val) {
      echo "fruits[" . $key . "] = " . $val . "\n";
  }
?>

The above example will output:

  fruits[0] = apple
  fruits[1] = banana
  fruits[2] = lemon
  fruits[3] = orange



The fruits have been sorted in alphabetical order.

This function assigns new keys to the elements in {array}. It will remove any
existing keys that may have been assigned, rather than just reordering the
keys.

Like most PHP sorting functions, |sort| uses an implementation of Quicksort.

Be careful when sorting arrays with mixed types values because |sort| can
produce unpredictable results.
