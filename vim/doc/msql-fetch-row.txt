*msql_fetch_row* -- Get row as enumerated array

  array msql_fetch_row(resource result)~

|msql_fetch_row| fetches one row of data from the result associated with the
specified query identifier. The row is returned as an array. Each result
column is stored in an array offset, starting at offset 0.

Subsequent call to |msql_fetch_row| would return the next row in the result
set, or FALSE if there are no more rows.

{ result}The result resource that is being evaluated. This result comes from a
call to |msql_query|.

Returns an array that corresponds to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are no
more rows.

<?php >
  $con = msql_connect();
  if (!$con) {
      die('Server connection problem: ' . msql_error());
  }
  
  if (!msql_select_db('test', $con)) {
      die('Database connection problem: ' . msql_error());
  }
  
  $result = msql_query('SELECT id, name FROM people', $con);
  if (!$result) {
      die('Query execution problem: ' . msql_error());
  }
  
  while ($row = msql_fetch_row($result)) {
      echo $row[0] . ': ' . $row[1] . "\n";
  }
