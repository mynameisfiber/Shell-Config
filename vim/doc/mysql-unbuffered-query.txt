*mysql_unbuffered_query* -- Send an SQL query to MySQL without fetching and
buffering the result rows.

  resource mysql_unbuffered_query(string query [, resource link_identifier])~

|mysql_unbuffered_query| sends the SQL query {query} to MySQL without
automatically fetching and buffering the result rows as |mysql_query| does.
This saves a considerable amount of memory with SQL queries that produce large
result sets, and you can start working on the result set immediately after the
first row has been retrieved as you don't have to wait until the complete SQL
query has been performed. To use |mysql_unbuffered_query| while multiple
database connections are open, you must specify the optional parameter
{link_identifier} to identify which connection you want to use.

{query} The SQL query to execute.

Data inside the query should be properly escaped.

{ link_identifier}The MySQL connection. If the link identifier is not
specified, the last link opened by |mysql_connect| is assumed. If no such link
is found, it will try to create one as if |mysql_connect| was called with no
arguments. If no connection is found or established, an E_WARNING level error
is generated.

For SELECT, SHOW, DESCRIBE or EXPLAIN statements, |mysql_unbuffered_query|
returns a resource on success, or FALSE on error.

For other type of SQL statements, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, etc,
|mysql_unbuffered_query| returns TRUE on success or FALSE on error.

The benefits of |mysql_unbuffered_query| come at a cost: you cannot use
|mysql_num_rows| and |mysql_data_seek| on a result set returned from
|mysql_unbuffered_query|. You also have to fetch all result rows from an
unbuffered SQL query before you can send a new SQL query to MySQL.
