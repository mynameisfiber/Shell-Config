*dio_truncate* -- Truncates file descriptor fd to offset bytes

  bool dio_truncate(resource fd, int offset)~

|dio_truncate| truncates a file to at most {offset} bytes in size.

If the file previously was larger than this size, the extra data is lost. If
the file previously was shorter, it is unspecified whether the file is left
unchanged or is extended. In the latter case the extended part reads as zero
bytes.

{fd} The file descriptor returned by |dio_open|.

{offset} The offset in bytes.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

This function is not implemented on Windows platforms.
