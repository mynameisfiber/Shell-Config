*proc_close* -- Close a process opened by proc_open and return the exit code of
that process

  int proc_close(resource process)~

|proc_close| is similar to |pclose| except that it only works on processes
opened by |proc_open|. |proc_close| waits for the process to terminate, and
returns its exit code. If you have open pipes to that process, you should
|fclose| them prior to calling this function in order to avoid a deadlock -
the child process may not be able to exit while the pipes are open.

{process} The |proc_open| resource that will be closed.

Returns the termination status of the process that was run. In case of an
error then -1 is returned.

|proc_close| is internally implemented using the waitpid(3) system call. To
obtain the real exit status code the |pcntl_wexitstatus| function should be
used.
