*xslt_set_log* -- Set the log file to write log messages to

  void xslt_set_log(resource xh [, mixed log])~

This function allows you to set the file in which you want XSLT log messages
to, XSLT log messages are different than error messages, in that log messages
are not actually error messages but rather messages related to the state of
the XSLT processor. They are useful for debugging XSLT, when something goes
wrong.

By default logging is disabled, in order to enable logging you must first call
|xslt_set_log| with a boolean parameter which enables logging, then if you
want to set the log file to debug to, you must then pass it a string
containing the filename.

{xh} The XSLT processor link identifier, created with |xslt_create|.

{log} This parameter is either a boolean value which toggles logging on and
off, or a string containing the logfile in which log errors too.

No value is returned.

Please note that file:// is needed in front of the path when using Windows.

Using the XSLT Logging features

<?php >
  $xh = xslt_create();
  xslt_set_log($xh, true);
  xslt_set_log($xh, getcwd() . '/myfile.log');
  
  $result = xslt_process($xh, 'dog.xml', 'pets.xsl');
  echo $result;
  
  xslt_free($xh);
?>
