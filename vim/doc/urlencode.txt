*urlencode* -- URL-encodes string

  string urlencode(string str)~

This function is convenient when encoding a string to be used in a query part
of a URL, as a convenient way to pass variables to the next page.

{str} The string to be encoded.

Returns a string in which all non-alphanumeric characters except -_. have been
replaced with a percent (%) sign followed by two hex digits and spaces encoded
as plus (+) signs. It is encoded the same way that the posted data from a WWW
form is encoded, that is the same way as in application/x-www-form-urlencoded
media type. This differs from the RFC 3986 encoding (see |rawurlencode|) in
that for historical reasons, spaces are encoded as plus (+) signs.

|urlencode| example

<?php >
  echo '<a href="mycgi?foo=', urlencode($userinput), '">';
?>





|urlencode| and |htmlentities| example

<?php >
  $query_string = 'foo=' . urlencode($foo) . '&amp;bar=' . urlencode($bar);
  echo '<a href="mycgi?' . htmlentities($query_string) . '">';
?>
