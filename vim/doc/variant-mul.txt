*variant_mul* -- Multiplies the values of the two variants

  mixed variant_mul(mixed left, mixed right)~

Multiplies {left} by {right}.

{left} The left operand.

{right} The right operand.

Boolean values are converted to -1 for FALSE and 0 for TRUE. As with all the
variant arithmetic functions, the parameters for this function can be either a
PHP native type (integer, string, floating point, boolean or NULL), or an
instance of a COM, VARIANT or DOTNET class. PHP native types will be converted
to variants using the same rules as found in the constructor for the class.
COM and DOTNET objects will have the value of their default property taken and
used as the variant value.

The variant arithmetic functions are wrappers around the similarly named
functions in the COM library; for more information on these functions, consult
the MSDN library. The PHP functions are named slightly differently; for
example |variant_add| in PHP corresponds to VarAdd() in the MSDN
documentation.
