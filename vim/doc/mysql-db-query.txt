*mysql_db_query* -- Send a MySQL query

  resource mysql_db_query(string database, string query [, resource link_identifier])~

|mysql_db_query| selects a database, and executes a query on it.

This function has been DEPRECATED as of PHP 5.3.0. Relying on this feature is
highly discouraged.

{database} The name of the database that will be selected.

{query} The MySQL query.

Data inside the query should be properly escaped.

{ link_identifier}The MySQL connection. If the link identifier is not
specified, the last link opened by |mysql_connect| is assumed. If no such link
is found, it will try to create one as if |mysql_connect| was called with no
arguments. If no connection is found or established, an E_WARNING level error
is generated.

Returns a positive MySQL result resource to the query result, or FALSE on
error. The function also returns TRUE/FALSE for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE queries
to indicate success/failure.

Version Description 5.3.0 This function now throws an E_DEPRECATED notice.
4.0.6 This function is deprecated, do not use this function. Use
|mysql_select_db| and |mysql_query| instead.

|mysql_db_query| alternative example

<?php >
  if (!$link = mysql_connect('mysql_host', 'mysql_user', 'mysql_password')) {
      echo 'Could not connect to mysql';
      exit;
  }
  
  if (!mysql_select_db('mysql_dbname', $link)) {
      echo 'Could not select database';
      exit;
  }
  
  $sql    = 'SELECT foo FROM bar WHERE id = 42';
  $result = mysql_query($sql, $link);
  
  if (!$result) {
      echo "DB Error, could not query the database\n";
      echo 'MySQL Error: ' . mysql_error();
      exit;
  }
  
  while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) {
      echo $row['foo'];
  }
  
  mysql_free_result($result);
?>





Be aware that this function does NOT switch back to the database you were
connected before. In other words, you can't use this function to temporarily
run a sql query on another database, you would have to manually switch back.
Users are strongly encouraged to use the database.table syntax in their sql
queries or |mysql_select_db| instead of this function.

|mysql_query| |mysql_select_db|
