*xdiff_file_patch_binary* -- Alias of xdiff_file_bpatch

  bool xdiff_file_patch_binary(string file, string patch, string dest)~

Patches a {file} with a binary {patch} and stores the result in a file {dest}.
This function accepts patches created both via |xdiff_file_bdiff| or
|xdiff_file_rabdiff| functions or their string counterparts.

Starting with version 1.5.0 this function is an alias of |xdiff_file_bpatch|.

{file} The original file.

{patch} The binary patch file.

{dest} Path of the resulting file.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

|xdiff_file_patch_binary| example The following code applies binary diff to a
file.

<?php >
  $old_version = 'archive-1.0.tgz';
  $patch = 'archive.bpatch';
  
  $result = xdiff_file_patch_binary($old_version, $patch, 'archive-1.1.tgz');
  if ($result) {
     echo "File patched";
  } else {
     echo "File couldn't be patched";
  }
?>



Both files ({file} and {patch}) will be loaded into memory so ensure that your
memory_limit is set high enough.
