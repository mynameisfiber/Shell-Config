*xml_set_character_data_handler* -- Set up character data handler

  bool xml_set_character_data_handler(resource parser, callback handler)~

Sets the character data handler function for the XML parser {parser}.

{parser} A reference to the XML parser to set up character data handler
function.

{handler} {handler} is a string containing the name of a function that must
exist when |xml_parse| is called for {parser}.

  bool (resource parser, callback handler, resource parser, string data)~

The function named by {handler} must accept two parameters: {parser} The first
parameter, parser, is a reference to the XML parser calling the handler.

{data} The second parameter, {data}, contains the character data as a string.

Character data handler is called for every piece of a text in the XML
document. It can be called multiple times inside each fragment (e.g. for
non-ASCII strings).

If a handler function is set to an empty string, or FALSE, the handler in
question is disabled.

Instead of a function name, an array containing an object reference and a
method name can also be supplied.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.
