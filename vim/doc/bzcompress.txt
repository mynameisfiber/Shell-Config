*bzcompress* -- Compress a string into bzip2 encoded data

  mixed bzcompress(string source [, int blocksize [, int workfactor]])~

|bzcompress| compresses the given string and returns it as bzip2 encoded data.

{source} The string to compress.

{blocksize} Specifies the blocksize used during compression and should be a
number from 1 to 9 with 9 giving the best compression, but using more
resources to do so.

{workfactor} Controls how the compression phase behaves when presented with
worst case, highly repetitive, input data. The value can be between 0 and 250
with 0 being a special case.

Regardless of the {workfactor}, the generated output is the same.

The compressed string or number of error in case of error.
