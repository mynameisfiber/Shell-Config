*iconv_strpos* -- Finds position of first occurrence of a needle within a
haystack

  int iconv_strpos(string haystack, string needle [, int offset [, string charset]])~

Finds position of first occurrence of a needle within a haystack.

In contrast to |strpos|, the return value of |iconv_strpos| is the number of
characters that appear before the needle, rather than the offset in bytes to
the position where the needle has been found. The characters are counted on
the basis of the specified character set {charset}.

{haystack} The entire string.

{needle} The searched substring.

{offset} The optional {offset} parameter specifies the position from which the
search should be performed.

{charset} If {charset} parameter is omitted, {string} are assumed to be
encoded in iconv.internal_encoding.

If {haystack} or {needle} is not a string, it is converted to a string and
applied as the ordinal value of a character.

Returns the numeric position of the first occurrence of {needle} in
{haystack}.

If {needle} is not found, |iconv_strpos| will return FALSE.

This function may return Boolean FALSE, but may also return a non-Boolean
value which evaluates to FALSE, such as 0 or "". Please read the section on
Booleans for more information. Use the === operator for testing the return
value of this function.
