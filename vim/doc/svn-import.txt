*svn_import* -- Imports an unversioned path into a repository

one that contains the PHP binary. To use the calling script"s working
directory, use |realpath| or dirname(__FILE__).

{url} Repository URL to import into.

{nonrecursive} Whether or not to refrain from recursively processing
directories.

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

Basic example This example demonstrates a basic use-case of this function. To
import a directory named new-files into the repository at
http://www.example.com/svnroot/incoming/abc, use:

<?php >
  svn_import(realpath('new-files'), 'http://www.example.com/svnroot/incoming/abc', false);
?>
