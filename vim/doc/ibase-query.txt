*ibase_query* -- Execute a query on an InterBase database

  resource ibase_query([resource link_identifier, string query [, int bind_args]])~

Performs a query on an InterBase database.

{link_identifier} An InterBase link identifier. If omitted, the last opened
link is assumed.

{query} An InterBase query.

{bind_args}

If the query raises an error, returns FALSE. If it is successful and there is
a (possibly empty) result set (such as with a SELECT query), returns a result
identifier. If the query was successful and there were no results, returns
TRUE.

In PHP 5.0.0 and up, this function will return the number of rows affected by
the query for INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements. In order to retain
backward compatibility, it will return TRUE for these statements if the query
succeeded without affecting any rows.

If you get some error like "arithmetic exception, numeric overflow, or string
truncation. Cannot transliterate character between character sets" (this
occurs when you try use some character with accents) when using this and after
|ibase_query| you must set the character set (i.e. ISO8859_1 or your current
character set).

Version Description 5.3.1 On success the function now returns TRUE if there
were no affected rows, where it previously returned 0 (a zero followed by an
empty space).
