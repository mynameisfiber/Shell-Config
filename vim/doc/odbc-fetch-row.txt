*odbc_fetch_row* -- Fetch a row

  bool odbc_fetch_row(resource result_id [, int row_number])~

Fetches a row of the data that was returned by |odbc_do| or |odbc_exec|. After
|odbc_fetch_row| is called, the fields of that row can be accessed with
|odbc_result|.

{result_id} The result identifier.

{row_number} If {row_number} is not specified, |odbc_fetch_row| will try to
fetch the next row in the result set. Calls to |odbc_fetch_row| with and
without {row_number} can be mixed.

To step through the result more than once, you can call |odbc_fetch_row| with
{row_number} 1, and then continue doing |odbc_fetch_row| without {row_number}
to review the result. If a driver doesn't support fetching rows by number, the
{row_number} parameter is ignored.

Returns TRUE if there was a row, FALSE otherwise.
