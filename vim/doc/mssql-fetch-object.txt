*mssql_fetch_object* -- Fetch row as object

  object mssql_fetch_object(resource result)~

|mssql_fetch_object| is similar to |mssql_fetch_array|, with one difference -
an object is returned, instead of an array. Indirectly, that means that you
can only access the data by the field names, and not by their offsets (numbers
are illegal property names).

Speed-wise, the function is identical to |mssql_fetch_array|, and almost as
quick as |mssql_fetch_row| (the difference is insignificant).

{result} The result resource that is being evaluated. This result comes from a
call to |mssql_query|.

Returns an object with properties that correspond to the fetched row, or FALSE
if there are no more rows.

|mssql_fetch_object| example

<?php >
  // Send a select query to MSSQL
  $query = mssql_query('SELECT [username], [name] FROM [php].[dbo].[userlist]');
  
  // Check if there were any records
  if (!mssql_num_rows($query)) {
      echo 'No records found';
  } else {
      // Print a nice list of users in the format of:
      // * name (username)
  
      echo '<ul>';
  
      while ($row = mssql_fetch_object($query)) {
          echo '<li>' . $row->name . ' (' . $row->username . ')</li>';
      }
  
      echo '</ul>';
  }
  
  // Free the query result
  mssql_free_result($query);
?>





Field names returned by this function are case-sensitive.

This function sets NULL fields to the PHP NULL value.
