*ifx_getsqlca* -- Get the contents of sqlca.sqlerrd[0..5] after a query

  array ifx_getsqlca(resource result_id)~

Returns a pseudo-row with sqlca.sqlerrd[0] ... sqlca.sqlerrd[5] after the
query associated with {result_id}.

For inserts, updates and deletes the values returned are those as set by the
server after executing the query. This gives access to the number of affected
rows and the serial insert value. For SELECTs the values are those saved after
the PREPARE statement. This gives access to the *estimated* number of affected
rows. The use of this function saves the overhead of executing a SELECT
dbinfo('sqlca.sqlerrdx') query, as it retrieves the values that were saved by
the ifx driver at the appropriate moment.

{result_id} {result_id} is a valid result id returned by |ifx_query| or
|ifx_prepare| (select type queries only!).

Returns an associative array with the following entries: sqlerrd0, sqlerrd1,
sqlerrd2, sqlerrd3, sqlerrd4 and sqlerrd5.

Retrieve Informix sqlca.sqlerrd[x] values

<?php >
  /* assume the first column of 'sometable' is a serial */

                    values (0, '2nd column', 'another column') ", $connid);
  if (!$qid) {
      /* ... error ... */
  }
  $sqlca = ifx_getsqlca($qid);
  $serial_value = $sqlca["sqlerrd1"];
  echo "The serial value of the inserted row is : $serial_value<br />\n";
