*posix_uname* -- Get system name

  array posix_uname()~

Gets information about the system.

Posix requires that assumptions must not be made about the format of the
values, e.g. the assumption that a release may contain three digits or
anything else returned by this function.

Returns a hash of strings with information about the system. The indices of
the hash are sysname - operating system name (e.g. Linux)

nodename - system name (e.g. valiant)

release - operating system release (e.g. 2.2.10)

version - operating system version (e.g. #4 Tue Jul 20 17:01:36 MEST 1999)

machine - system architecture (e.g. i586)

domainname - DNS domainname (e.g. example.com)

domainname is a GNU extension and not part of POSIX.1, so this field is only
available on GNU systems or when using the GNU libc.

Example use of |posix_uname|

<?php >
  $uname=posix_uname();
  print_r($uname);
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Array
  (
      [sysname] => Linux
      [nodename] => funbox
      [release] => 2.6.20-15-server
      [version] => #2 SMP Sun Apr 15 07:41:34 UTC 2007
      [machine] => i686
  )
