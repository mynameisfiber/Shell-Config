*ftp_nb_put* -- Stores a file on the FTP server (non-blocking)

  int ftp_nb_put(resource ftp_stream, string remote_file, string local_file, int mode [, int startpos])~

|ftp_nb_put| stores a local file on the FTP server.

The difference between this function and the |ftp_put| is that this function
uploads the file asynchronously, so your program can perform other operations
while the file is being uploaded.

{ftp_stream} The link identifier of the FTP connection.

{remote_file} The remote file path.

{local_file} The local file path.

{mode} The transfer mode. Must be either FTP_ASCII or FTP_BINARY.

{startpos} The position in the remote file to start uploading to.

Returns FTP_FAILED or FTP_FINISHED or FTP_MOREDATA.

|ftp_nb_put| example

<?php >
  // Initiate the Upload
  $ret = ftp_nb_put($my_connection, "test.remote", "test.local", FTP_BINARY);
  while ($ret == FTP_MOREDATA) {
     
     // Do whatever you want
     echo ".";
  
     // Continue uploading...
     $ret = ftp_nb_continue($my_connection);
  }
  if ($ret != FTP_FINISHED) {
     echo "There was an error uploading the file...";
     exit(1);
  }
?>



Resuming an upload with |ftp_nb_put|

<?php >
  // Initiate
  $ret = ftp_nb_put($my_connection, "test.remote", "test.local", 
                        FTP_BINARY, ftp_size("test.remote"));
  // OR: $ret = ftp_nb_put($my_connection, "test.remote", "test.local", 
  //                           FTP_BINARY, FTP_AUTORESUME);
  
  while ($ret == FTP_MOREDATA) {
     
     // Do whatever you want
     echo ".";
  
     // Continue uploading...
     $ret = ftp_nb_continue($my_connection);
  }
  if ($ret != FTP_FINISHED) {
     echo "There was an error uploading the file...";
     exit(1);
  }
?>
