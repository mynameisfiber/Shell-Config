*ereg* -- Regular expression match

  int ereg(string pattern, string string [, array regs])~

Searches a {string} for matches to the regular expression given in {pattern}
in a case-sensitive way.

This function has been DEPRECATED as of PHP 5.3.0. Relying on this feature is
highly discouraged.

{pattern} Case sensitive regular expression.

{string} The input string.

{regs} If matches are found for parenthesized substrings of {pattern} and the
function is called with the third argument {regs}, the matches will be stored
in the elements of the array {regs}.

$regs[1] will contain the substring which starts at the first left
parenthesis; $regs[2] will contain the substring starting at the second, and
so on. $regs[0] will contain a copy of the complete string matched.

Returns the length of the matched string if a match for {pattern} was found in
{string}, or FALSE if no matches were found or an error occurred.

If the optional parameter {regs} was not passed or the length of the matched
string is 0, this function returns 1.

Version Description 4.1.0 Up to (and including) PHP 4.1.0 $regs will be filled
with exactly ten elements, even though more or fewer than ten parenthesized
substrings may actually have matched. This has no effect on |ereg|'s ability
to match more substrings. If no matches are found, $regs will not be altered
by |ereg|.

|ereg| example The following code snippet takes a date in ISO format
(YYYY-MM-DD) and prints it in DD.MM.YYYY format:

<?php >
  if (ereg ("([0-9]{4})-([0-9]{1,2})-([0-9]{1,2})", $date, $regs)) {
      echo "$regs[3].$regs[2].$regs[1]";
  } else {
      echo "Invalid date format: $date";
  }
?>



As of PHP 5.3.0, the regex extension is deprecated in favor of the PCRE
extension. Calling this function will issue an E_DEPRECATED notice. See the
list of differences for help on converting to PCRE.

|preg_match|, which uses a Perl-compatible regular expression syntax, is often
a faster alternative to |ereg|.
