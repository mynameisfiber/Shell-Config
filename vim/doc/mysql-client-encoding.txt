  string mysql_client_encoding([resource link_identifier])~

Retrieves the character_set variable from MySQL.

{ link_identifier}The MySQL connection. If the link identifier is not
specified, the last link opened by |mysql_connect| is assumed. If no such link
is found, it will try to create one as if |mysql_connect| was called with no
arguments. If no connection is found or established, an E_WARNING level error
is generated.

  $link    = mysql_connect('localhost', 'mysql_user', 'mysql_password');

?>
