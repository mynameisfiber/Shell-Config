*sybase_deadlock_retry_count* -- Sets the deadlock retry count

  void sybase_deadlock_retry_count(int retry_count)~

Using |sybase_deadlock_retry_count|, the number of retries can be defined in
cases of deadlocks. By default, every deadlock is retried an infinite number
of times or until the process is killed by Sybase, the executing script is
killed (for instance, by |set_time_limit|) or the query succeeds.

{retry_count} Values for retry_count -1 Retry forever (default) 0 Do not retry
n Retry n times

No value is returned.

This function is only available when using the CT library interface to Sybase,
and not with the DB library.
