*ftp_alloc* -- Allocates space for a file to be uploaded

  bool ftp_alloc(resource ftp_stream, int filesize [, string result])~

Sends an ALLO command to the remote FTP server to allocate space for a file to
be uploaded.

Many FTP servers do not support this command. These servers may return a
failure code (FALSE) indicating the command is not supported or a success code
(TRUE) to indicate that pre-allocation is not necessary and the client should
continue as though the operation were successful. Because of this, it may be
best to reserve this function for servers which explicitly require
preallocation.



{ftp_stream} The link identifier of the FTP connection.

{filesize} The number of bytes to allocate.

{result} A textual representation of the servers response will be returned by
reference in {result} if a variable is provided.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.
