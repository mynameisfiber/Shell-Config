*strncmp* -- Binary safe string comparison of the first n characters

  int strncmp(string str1, string str2, int len)~

the (upper limit of the) number of characters from each string to be used in
the comparison.

Note that this comparison is case sensitive.

{str1} The first string.

{str2} The second string.

{len} Number of characters to use in the comparison.
