*php_sapi_name* -- Returns the type of interface between web server and PHP

  string php_sapi_name()~

Returns a lowercase string that describes the type of interface (the Server
API, SAPI) that PHP is using. For example, in CLI PHP this string will be
"cli" whereas with Apache it may have several different values depending on
the exact SAPI used. Possible values are listed below.

Returns the interface type, as a lowercase string.

Although not exhaustive, the possible return values include aolserver, apache,
apache2filter, apache2handler, caudium, cgi (until PHP 5.3), cgi-fcgi, cli,
continuity, embed, isapi, litespeed, milter, nsapi, phttpd, pi3web, roxen,
thttpd, tux, and webjames.

|php_sapi_name| example This example checks for the substring cgi because it
may also be cgi-fcgi.

<?php >
  $sapi_type = php_sapi_name();
  if (substr($sapi_type, 0, 3) == 'cgi') {
      echo "You are using CGI PHP\n";
  } else {
      echo "You are not using CGI PHP\n";
  }
?>



The PHP constant PHP_SAPI has the same value as |php_sapi_name|.

The defined SAPI may not be obvious, because for example instead of apache it
may be defined as apache2handler or apache2filter.
