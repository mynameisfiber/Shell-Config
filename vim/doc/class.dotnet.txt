*DOTNET* -- DOTNET class

The DOTNET class allows you to instantiate a class from a .Net assembly and
call its methods and access its properties.

  string DOTNET::DOTNET(string assembly_name, string class_name [, int codepage])~

DOTNET class constructor. {assembly_name} specifies which assembly should be
loaded, and {class_name} specifices which class in that assembly to
instantiate. You may optionally specify a {codepage} to use for unicode string
transformations; see the class for more details on code pages.

The returned object is an overloaded object, which means that PHP does not see
any fixed methods as it does with regular classes; instead, any property or
method accesses are passed through to COM and from there to DOTNET. In other
words, the .Net object is mapped through the COM interoperability layer
provided by the .Net runtime.

Once you have created a DOTNET object, PHP treats it identically to any other
COM object; all the same rules apply.

DOTNET example

<?php >
   $stack = new DOTNET("mscorlib", "System.Collections.Stack");
   $stack->Push(".Net");
   $stack->Push("Hello ");
   echo $stack->Pop() . $stack->Pop();
?>





You need to install the .Net runtime on your web server to take advantage of
this feature.
