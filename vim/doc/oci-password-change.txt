*oci_password_change* -- Changes password of Oracle's user

  bool oci_password_change(resource connection, string username, string old_password, string new_password)~

  resource oci_password_change(resource connection, string username, string old_password, string new_password, string dbname, string username, string old_password, string new_password)~

Changes password for user with {username}.

The |oci_password_change| function is most useful for PHP command-line
scripts, or when non-persistent connections are used throughout the PHP
application.

{connection} An Oracle connection identifier, returned by |oci_connect| or
|oci_pconnect|.

{username} The Oracle user name.

{old_password} The old password.

{new_password} The new password to be set.

{dbname} The database name.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

Changing the password either with this function or directly in Oracle should
be done carefully. This is because PHP applications may continue to
successfully reuse persistent connections by authenticating with the old
password. The best practice is to restart all web servers whenever the user
password is changed.

The second |oci_password_change| syntax is available since OCI8 version 1.1.

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ocipasswordchange| instead. This
name still can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_password_change| for
downwards compatability. This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.
