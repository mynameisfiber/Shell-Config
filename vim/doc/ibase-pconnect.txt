*ibase_pconnect* -- Open a persistent connection to an InterBase database

  resource ibase_pconnect([string database [, string username [, string password [, string charset [, int buffers [, int dialect [, string role [, int sync]]]]]]]])~

Opens a persistent connection to an InterBase database.

|ibase_pconnect| acts very much like |ibase_connect| with two major
differences.

First, when connecting, the function will first try to find a (persistent)
link that's already opened with the same parameters. If one is found, an
identifier for it will be returned instead of opening a new connection.

Second, the connection to the InterBase server will not be closed when the
execution of the script ends. Instead, the link will remain open for future
use (|ibase_close| will not close links established by |ibase_pconnect|). This
type of link is therefore called 'persistent'.

{database} The {database} argument has to be a valid path to database file on
the server it resides on. If the server is not local, it must be prefixed with
either 'hostname:' (TCP/IP), '//hostname/' (NetBEUI) or 'hostname@' (IPX/SPX),
depending on the connection protocol used.

{username} The user name. Can be set with the ibase.default_user php.ini
directive.

{password} The password for {username}. Can be set with the
ibase.default_password php.ini directive.

{charset} {charset} is the default character set for a database.

{buffers} {buffers} is the number of database buffers to allocate for the
server-side cache. If 0 or omitted, server chooses its own default.

{dialect} {dialect} selects the default SQL dialect for any statement executed
within a connection, and it defaults to the highest one supported by client
libraries. Functional only with InterBase 6 and up.

{role} Functional only with InterBase 5 and up.

{sync}

Returns an InterBase link identifier on success, or FALSE on error.
