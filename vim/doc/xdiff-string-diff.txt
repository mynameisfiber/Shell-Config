*xdiff_string_diff* -- Make unified diff of two strings

  string xdiff_string_diff(string old_data, string new_data [, int context [, bool minimal]])~

Makes an unified diff containing differences between {old_data} string and
{new_data} string and returns it. The resulting diff is human-readable. An
optional {context} parameter specifies how many lines of context should be
added around each change. Setting {minimal} parameter to true will result in
outputting the shortest patch file possible (can take a long time).

{old_data} First string with data. It acts as "old" data.

{new_data} Second string with data. It acts as "new" data.

{context} Indicates how many lines of context you want to include in the diff
result.

{minimal} Set this parameter to TRUE if you want to minimalize the size of the
result (can take a long time).

Returns string with resulting diff or FALSE if an internal error happened.

|xdiff_string_diff| example The following code makes unified diff of two
articles.

<?php >
  $old_article = file_get_contents('./old_article.txt');
  $new_article = $_REQUEST['article']; /* Let's say that someone pasted a new article to html form */
  
  $diff = xdiff_string_diff($old_article, $new_article, 1);
  if (is_string($diff)) {
      echo "Differences between two articles:\n";
      echo $diff;
  }
?>



This function doesn't work well with binary strings. To make diff of binary
strings use |xdiff_string_bdiff|/|xdiff_string_rabdiff|.
