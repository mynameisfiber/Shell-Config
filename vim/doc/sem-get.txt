*sem_get* -- Get a semaphore id

  resource sem_get(int key [, int max_acquire [, int perm [, int auto_release]]])~

|sem_get| returns an id that can be used to access the System V semaphore with
the given {key}.

A second call to |sem_get| for the same key will return a different semaphore
identifier, but both identifiers access the same underlying semaphore.

{key}

{max_acquire} The number of processes that can acquire the semaphore
simultaneously is set to {max_acquire}.

{perm} The semaphore permissions. Actually this value is set only if the
process finds it is the only process currently attached to the semaphore.

{auto_release} Specifies if the semaphore should be automatically released on
request shutdown.

Returns a positive semaphore identifier on success, or FALSE on error.

Version Description 4.3.0 The {auto_release} parameter was added.
