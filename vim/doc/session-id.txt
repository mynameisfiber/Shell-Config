*session_id* -- Get and/or set the current session id

  string session_id([string id])~

|session_id| is used to get or set the session id for the current session.

The constant SID can also be used to retrieve the current name and session id
as a string suitable for adding to URLs. See also Session handling.

{id} If {id} is specified, it will replace the current session id.
|session_id| needs to be called before |session_start| for that purpose.
Depending on the session handler, not all characters are allowed within the
session id. For example, the file session handler only allows characters in
the range a-z A-Z 0-9 , (comma) and - (minus)!

When using session cookies, specifying an {id} for |session_id| will always
send a new cookie when |session_start| is called, regardless if the current
session id is identical to the one being set.

|session_id| returns the session id for the current session or the empty
string ("") if there is no current session (no current session id exists).

Version Description 5.0.0 The , (comma) and - (minus) characters are allowed
in the file session handler.
