*svn_diff* -- Recursively diffs two paths

  array svn_diff(string path1, int rev1, string path2, int rev2)~

Recursively diffs two paths, {path1} and {path2}.

This is not a general-purpose diff utility. Only local files that are
versioned may be diffed: other files will fail.

{path1} First path to diff. This can be a URL to a file/directory in an SVN
repository or a local file/directory path.

Relative paths will be resolved as if the current working directory was the
one that contains the PHP binary. To use the calling script"s working
directory, use |realpath| or dirname(__FILE__).

If a local file path has only backslashes and no forward slashes, this
extension will fail to find the path. Always replace all backslashes with
forward slashes when using this function.

{rev1} First path's revision number. Use SVN_REVISION_HEAD to specify the most
recent revision.

{path2} Second path to diff. See {path1} for description.

{rev2} Second path's revision number. See {rev1} for description.

Returns an array-list consisting of two streams: the first is the diff output
and the second contains error stream output. The streams can be read using
|fread|. Returns FALSE or NULL on error.

The diff output will, by default, be in the form of Subversion's custom
unified diff format, but an external diff engine may be used depending on
Subversion's configuration.

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

Basic example This example demonstrates the basic usage of this function, and
the retrieval of contents from the stream:

<?php >
  list($diff, $errors) = svn_diff(
      'http://www.example.com/svnroot/trunk/foo', SVN_REVISION_HEAD,
      'http://www.example.com/svnroot/branches/dev/foo', SVN_REVISION_HEAD
  );
  if (!$diff) exit;
  $contents = '';
  while (!feof($diff)) {
    $contents .= fread($diff, 8192);
  }
  fclose($diff);
  fclose($errors);
  var_dump($contents);
?>

The above example will output:

  Index: http://www.example.com/svnroot/trunk/foo
  ===================================================================
  --- http://www.example.com/svnroot/trunk/foo        (.../foo) (revision 23)
  +++ http://www.example.com/svnroot/branches/dev/foo (.../foo) (revision 27)
   // further diff output



Diffing two revisions of a repository path This example implements a wrapper
function that allows a user to easily diff two revisions of the same item
using an external repository path (the default syntax is somewhat verbose):

<?php >
  function svn_diff_same_item($path, $rev1, $rev2) {
      return svn_diff($path, $rev1, $path, $rev2);
  }
?>



Portably diffing two local files This example implements a wrapper function
that portably diffs two local files, compensating for the |realpath| fix and
the backslashes bug:

<?php >
  function svn_diff_local($path1, $rev1, $path2, $rev2) {
      $path1 = str_replace('\\', '/', realpath($path1));
      $path2 = str_replace('\\', '/', realpath($path2));
      return svn_diff($path1, $rev1, $path2, $rev2);
  }
?>
