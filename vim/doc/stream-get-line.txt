*stream_get_line* -- Gets line from stream resource up to a given delimiter

  string stream_get_line(resource handle, int length [, string ending])~

Gets a line from the given handle.

Reading ends when {length} bytes have been read, when the string specified by
{ending} is found (which is not included in the return value), or on EOF
(whichever comes first).

This function is nearly identical to |fgets| except in that it allows end of
line delimiters other than the standard \n, \r, and \r\n, and does not return
the delimiter itself.

{handle} A valid file handle.

{length} The number of bytes to read from the handle.

{ending} An optional string delimiter.

Returns a string of up to {length} bytes read from the file pointed to by
{handle}.

If an error occurs, returns FALSE.
