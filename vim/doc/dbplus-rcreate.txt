*dbplus_rcreate* -- Creates a new DB++ relation

  resource dbplus_rcreate(string name, mixed domlist [, bool overwrite])~

Creates a new relation. Any existing relation sharing the same {name} will be
overwritten if the relation is currently not in use and {overwrite} is set to
TRUE.

{name}

{domlist} A combination of domains. May be passed as a single domain name
string or as an array of domain names.

This parameter should contain the domain specification for the new relation
within an array of domain description strings. A domain description string
consists of a domain name unique to this relation, a slash and a type
specification character. See the db++ documentation, especially the
dbcreate(1) manpage, for a description of available type specifiers and their
meanings.

This function will also accept a string with space delimited domain
description strings, but it is recommended to use an array

{overwrite}



This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.
