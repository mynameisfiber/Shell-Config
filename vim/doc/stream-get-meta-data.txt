*stream_get_meta_data* -- Retrieves header/meta data from streams/file pointers

  array stream_get_meta_data(resource stream)~

Returns information about an existing {stream}.

{stream} The stream can be any stream created by |fopen|, |fsockopen| and
|pfsockopen|.

The result array contains the following items:

timed_out (bool) - TRUE if the stream timed out while waiting for data on the
last call to |fread| or |fgets|.

blocked (bool) - TRUE if the stream is in blocking IO mode. See
|stream_set_blocking|.

eof (bool) - TRUE if the stream has reached end-of-file. Note that for socket
streams this member can be TRUE even when unread_bytes is non-zero. To
determine if there is more data to be read, use |feof| instead of reading this
item.

unread_bytes (int) - the number of bytes currently contained in the PHP's own
internal buffer.

You shouldn't use this value in a script.

stream_type (string) - a label describing the underlying implementation of the
stream.

wrapper_type (string) - a label describing the protocol wrapper implementation
layered over the stream. See for more information about wrappers.

wrapper_data (mixed) - wrapper specific data attached to this stream. See for
more information about wrappers and their wrapper data.

filters (array) - and array containing the names of any filters that have been
stacked onto this stream. Documentation on filters can be found in the Filters
appendix.

mode (string) - the type of access required for this stream (see Table 1 of
the fopen() reference)

seekable (bool) - whether the current stream can be seeked.

uri (string) - the URI/filename associated with this stream.

Version Description 5.0.0 The following entries were added in the returned
array: mode, seekable, and uri. 4.3.0 The following entries were added in the
returned array: stream_type, wrapper_type, wrapper_data, and filters. 4.3.0
|socket_get_status| is an alias for this function. Prior to PHP 4.3.0, it was
used to retrieve the first four items, for socket based streams only.

|stream_get_meta_data| example

<?php >
  $url = 'http://www.example.com/';
  
  if (!$fp = fopen($url, 'r')) {
      trigger_error("Unable to open URL ($url)", E_USER_ERROR);
  }
  
  $meta = stream_get_meta_data($fp);
  
  print_r($meta);
  
  fclose($fp);
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Array
  (
      [wrapper_data] => Array
          (
              [0] => HTTP/1.1 200 OK
              [1] => Server: Apache/2.2.3 (Red Hat)
              [2] => Last-Modified: Tue, 15 Nov 2005 13:24:10 GMT
              [3] => ETag: "b300b4-1b6-4059a80bfd280"
              [4] => Accept-Ranges: bytes
              [5] => Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
              [6] => Set-Cookie: FOO=BAR; expires=Fri, 21-Dec-2012 12:00:00 GMT; path=/; domain=.example.com
              [6] => Connection: close     
              [7] => Date: Fri, 16 Oct 2009 12:00:00 GMT
              [8] => Age: 1164   
              [9] => Content-Length: 438
          )
  
      [wrapper_type] => http
      [stream_type] => tcp_socket/ssl
      [mode] => r
      [unread_bytes] => 438
      [seekable] => 
      [uri] => http://www.example.com/
      [timed_out] => 
      [blocked] => 1
      [eof] => 
  )



This function does NOT work on sockets created by the Socket extension.
