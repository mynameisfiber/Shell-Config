*mb_eregi_replace* -- Replace regular expression with multibyte support ignoring
case

  string mb_eregi_replace(string pattern, string replace, string string [, string option])~

Scans {string} for matches to {pattern}, then replaces the matched text with
{replacement}.

{pattern} The regular expression pattern. Multibyte characters may be used.
The case will be ignored.

{replace} The replacement text.

{string} The searched string.

{option} {option} has the same meaning as in |mb_ereg_replace|.

The resultant string or FALSE on error.

The internal encoding or the character encoding specified by
|mb_regex_encoding| will be used as the character encoding for this function.

Never use the e modifier when working on untrusted input. No automatic
escaping will happen (as known from |preg_replace|). Not taking care of this
will most likely create remote code execution vulnerabilities in your
application.

|mb_regex_encoding| |mb_ereg_replace|
