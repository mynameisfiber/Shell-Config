*pg_field_type_oid* -- Returns the type ID (OID) for the corresponding field
number

  int pg_field_type_oid(resource result, int field_number)~

|pg_field_type_oid| returns an integer containing the OID of the base type of
the given {field_number} in the given PostgreSQL {result} resource.

You can get more information about the field type by querying PostgreSQL's
pg_type system table using the OID obtained with this function. The PostgreSQL
|format_type| function will convert a type OID into an SQL standard type name.

If the field uses a PostgreSQL domain (rather than a basic type), it is the
OID of the domain's underlying type that is returned, rather than the OID of
the domain itself.

{result} PostgreSQL query result resource, returned by |pg_query|,
|pg_query_params| or |pg_execute| (among others).

{field_number} Field number, starting from 0.

The OID of the field's base type. FALSE is returned on error.

Getting information about fields

<?php >
    $dbconn = pg_connect("dbname=publisher") or die("Could not connect");
  
    // Assume 'title' is a varchar type
    $res = pg_query($dbconn, "select title from authors where author = 'Orwell'");
  
    echo "Title field type OID: ", pg_field_type_oid($res, 0);
?>

The above example will output:

  Title field type OID: 1043
