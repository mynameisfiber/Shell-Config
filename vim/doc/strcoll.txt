*strcoll* -- Locale based string comparison

  int strcoll(string str1, string str2)~

Note that this comparison is case sensitive, and unlike |strcmp| this function
is not binary safe.

|strcoll| uses the current locale for doing the comparisons. If the current
locale is C or POSIX, this function is equivalent to |strcmp|.

{str1} The first string.

{str2} The second string.
