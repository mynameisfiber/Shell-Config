          $bgc = imagecolorallocate ($im, 255, 255, 255);
          $tc = imagecolorallocate ($im, 0, 0, 0);
  
          imagefilledrectangle ($im, 0, 0, 150, 30, $bgc);
  
          /* Output an error message */
          imagestring ($im, 1, 5, 5, 'Error loading ' . $imgname, $tc);
      }

GIF support was removed from the GD library in Version 1.6, and added back in
Version 2.0.28. This function is not available between these versions.

Windows versions of PHP prior to PHP 4.3.0 do not support access of remote
files via this function, even if allow_url_fopen is enabled.
