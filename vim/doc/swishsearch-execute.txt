*SwishSearch->execute* -- Execute the search and get the results

  object SwishSearch->execute([string query])~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

Searches the index file(s) based on the parameters set in the search object.

{query} The query string is an optional parameter, it can be also set using
|Swish->prepare| method. The query string is preserved between executions, so
you can set it once, but execute the search multiple times.

Returns SwishResults object.

Throws SwishException on error.

Basic |SwishSearch->execute| example

<?php >
  try {
  
      $swish = new Swish("index.swish-e");
      $search = $swish->prepare();
  
      $results = $search->execute("query");
      echo "First query found: ", $results->hits, " hits\n";
  
      $results = $search->execute("new OR query");
      echo "Second query found: ", $results->hits, " hits\n";
  
  } catch (SwishException $e) {
      echo $e->getMessage(), "\n";
  }
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  First query found: 2 hits
  Second query found: 12 hits
