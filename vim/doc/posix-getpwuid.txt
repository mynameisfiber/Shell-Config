*posix_getpwuid* -- Return info about a user by user id

  array posix_getpwuid(int uid)~

Returns an array of information about the user referenced by the given user
ID.

{uid} The user identifier.

Returns an associative array with the following elements: The user information
array Element Description name The name element contains the username of the
user. This is a short, usually less than 16 character "handle" of the user,
not the real, full name. passwd The passwd element contains the user's
password in an encrypted format. Often, for example on a system employing
"shadow" passwords, an asterisk is returned instead. uid User ID, should be
the same as the {uid} parameter used when calling the function, and hence
redundant. gid The group ID of the user. Use the function |posix_getgrgid| to
resolve the group name and a list of its members. gecos GECOS is an obsolete
term that refers to the finger information field on a Honeywell batch
processing system. The field, however, lives on, and its contents have been
formalized by POSIX. The field contains a comma separated list containing the
user's full name, office phone, office number, and home phone number. On most
systems, only the user's full name is available. dir This element contains the
absolute path to the home directory of the user. shell The shell element
contains the absolute path to the executable of the user's default shell.

Example use of |posix_getpwuid|

<?php >
  $userinfo = posix_getpwuid(10000);
  
  print_r($userinfo);
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Array
  (
      [name]    => tom
      [passwd]  => x
      [uid]     => 10000
      [gid]     => 42
      [geocs]   => "tom,,,"
      [dir]     => "/home/tom"
      [shell]   => "/bin/bash"
  )
