*variant_get_type* -- Returns the type of a variant object

  int variant_get_type(variant variant)~

Returns the type of a variant object.

{variant} The variant object.

This function returns an integer value that indicates the type of {variant},
which can be an instance of , or classes. The return value can be compared to
one of the VT_XXX constants.

The return value for COM and DOTNET objects will usually be VT_DISPATCH; the
only reason this function works for those classes is because COM and DOTNET
are descendants of VARIANT.

In PHP versions prior to 5, you could obtain this information from instances
of the VARIANT class ONLY, by reading a fake {type} property. See the class
for more information on this.
