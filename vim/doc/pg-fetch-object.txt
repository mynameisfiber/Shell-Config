*pg_fetch_object* -- Fetch a row as an object

  object pg_fetch_object(resource result [, int row [, int result_type]])~

  object pg_fetch_object(resource result [, int row [, int result_type, resource result [, int row [, string class_name [, array params]]]]])~

|pg_fetch_object| returns an object with properties that correspond to the
fetched row's field names. It can optionally instantiate an object of a
specific class, and pass parameters to that class's constructor.

This function sets NULL fields to the PHP NULL value.

Speed-wise, the function is identical to |pg_fetch_array|, and almost as fast
as |pg_fetch_row| (the difference is insignificant).

{result} PostgreSQL query result resource, returned by |pg_query|,
|pg_query_params| or |pg_execute| (among others).

{row} Row number in result to fetch. Rows are numbered from 0 upwards. If
omitted or NULL, the next row is fetched.

{result_type} Ignored and deprecated.

{class_name} The name of the class to instantiate, set the properties of and
return. If not specified, a stdClass object is returned.

{params} An optional array of parameters to pass to the constructor for
{class_name} objects.

An object with one attribute for each field name in the result. Database NULL
values are returned as NULL.

FALSE is returned if {row} exceeds the number of rows in the set, there are no
more rows, or on any other error.

Version Description 5.0.0 {class_name} and {params} were added. The old form
with {result_type} still exists for backwards compatibility. 4.3.0
{result_type} default changed from PGSQL_BOTH to PGSQL_ASSOC, since the
numeric index was illegal. 4.1.0 The parameter {row} became optional.

|pg_fetch_object| example

<?php >
  $database = "store";
  
  $db_conn = pg_connect("host=localhost port=5432 dbname=$database");
  if (!$db_conn) {
    echo "Failed connecting to postgres database $database\n";
    exit;
  }
  
  $qu = pg_query($db_conn, "SELECT * FROM books ORDER BY author");
  
  
  while ($data = pg_fetch_object($qu)) {
    echo $data->author . " (";
    echo $data->year . "): ";
    echo $data->title . "<br />";
  }
  
  pg_free_result($qu);
  pg_close($db_conn);
?>
