*iconv_strrpos* -- Finds the last occurrence of a needle within a haystack

  int iconv_strrpos(string haystack, string needle [, string charset])~

In contrast to |strpos|, the return value of |iconv_strrpos| is the number of
characters that appear before the needle, rather than the offset in bytes to
the position where the needle has been found.

{haystack} The entire string.

{needle} The searched substring.

{charset} If {charset} parameter is omitted, {string} are assumed to be
encoded in iconv.internal_encoding.

If {haystack} or {needle} is not a string, it is converted to a string and
applied as the ordinal value of a character.

Returns the numeric position of the last occurrence of {needle} in {haystack}.
The characters are counted on the basis of the specified character set
{charset}.

If {needle} is not found, |iconv_strrpos| will return FALSE.

This function may return Boolean FALSE, but may also return a non-Boolean
value which evaluates to FALSE, such as 0 or "". Please read the section on
Booleans for more information. Use the === operator for testing the return
value of this function.
