*str_ireplace* -- Case-insensitive version of str_replace.

  mixed str_ireplace(mixed search, mixed replace, mixed subject [, int count])~

This function returns a string or an array with all occurrences of {search} in
{subject} (ignoring case) replaced with the given {replace} value. If you
don't need fancy replacing rules, you should generally use this function
instead of |preg_replace| with the i modifier.

If {search} and {replace} are arrays, then |str_ireplace| takes a value from
each array and uses them to search and replace on {subject}. If {replace} has
fewer values than {search}, then an empty string is used for the rest of
replacement values. If {search} is an array and {replace} is a string, then
this replacement string is used for every value of {search}. The converse
would not make sense, though.

If {search} or {replace} are arrays, their elements are processed first to
last.

{search} The value being searched for, otherwise known as the needle. An array
may be used to designate multiple needles.

{replace} The replacement value that replaces found {search} values. An array
may be used to designate multiple replacements.

{subject} The string or array being searched and replaced on, otherwise known
as the haystack.

If {subject} is an array, then the search and replace is performed with every
entry of {subject}, and the return value is an array as well.

{count} If passed, this will be set to the number of replacements performed.

Returns a string or an array of replacements.

Version Description 5.0.0 The {count} parameter was added.

|str_ireplace| example

<?php >
  $bodytag = str_ireplace("%body%", "black", "<body text=%BODY%>");
?>





This function is binary-safe.

Because |str_ireplace| replaces left to right, it might replace a previously
inserted value when doing multiple replacements. See also the examples in this
document.

|str_replace| |preg_replace| |strtr|
