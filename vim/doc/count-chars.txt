*count_chars* -- Return information about characters used in a string

  mixed count_chars(string string [, int mode])~

Counts the number of occurrences of every byte-value (0..255) in {string} and
returns it in various ways.

{string} The examined string.

{mode} See return values.

Depending on {mode} |count_chars| returns one of the following: 0 - an array
with the byte-value as key and the frequency of every byte as value.

1 - same as 0 but only byte-values with a frequency greater than zero are
listed.

2 - same as 0 but only byte-values with a frequency equal to zero are listed.

3 - a string containing all unique characters is returned.

4 - a string containing all not used characters is returned.

|count_chars| example

<?php >
  $data = "Two Ts and one F.";
  
  foreach (count_chars($data, 1) as $i => $val) {
     echo "There were $val instance(s) of \"" , chr($i) , "\" in the string.\n";
  }
?>

The above example will output:

  There were 4 instance(s) of " " in the string.
