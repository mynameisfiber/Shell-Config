*exif_imagetype* -- Determine the type of an image

  int exif_imagetype(string filename)~

|exif_imagetype| reads the first bytes of an image and checks its signature.

|exif_imagetype| can be used to avoid calls to other exif functions with
unsupported file types or in conjunction with $_SERVER['HTTP_ACCEPT'] to check
whether or not the viewer is able to see a specific image in the browser.

{filename} The image being checked.

When a correct signature is found, the appropriate constant value will be
returned otherwise the return value is FALSE. The return value is the same
value that |getimagesize| returns in index 2 but |exif_imagetype| is much
faster.

Version Description 5.3.0 Added icon support. 4.3.2 Support for JPC, JP2, JPX,
