*timezone_name_from_abbr* -- Returns the timezone name from abbreviation

  string timezone_name_from_abbr(string abbr [, int gmtOffset [, int isdst]])~

{abbr} Time zone abbreviation.

{gmtOffset} Offset from GMT in seconds. Defaults to -1 which means that first
found time zone corresponding to {abbr} is returned. Otherwise exact offset is
searched and only if not found then the first time zone with any offset is
returned.

{isdst} Daylight saving time indicator. Defaults to -1, which means that
whether the time zone has daylight saving or not is not taken into
consideration when searching. If this is set to 1, then the {gmtOffset} is
assumed to be an offset with daylight saving in effect; if 0, then {gmtOffset}
is assumed to be an offset without daylight saving in effect. If {abbr}
doesn't exist then the time zone is searched solely by the {gmtOffset} and
{isdst}.

Returns time zone name on success or FALSE on failure.
