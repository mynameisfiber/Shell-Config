*oci_set_edition* -- Sets the database edition

  bool oci_set_edition(string edition)~

Sets the database "edition" of objects to be used by a subsequent connections.

Oracle Editions allow concurrent versions of applications to run using the
same schema and object names. This is useful for upgrading live systems.

Call |oci_set_edition| before calling |oci_connect|, |oci_pconnect| or
|oci_new_connect|.

If an edition is set that is not valid in the database, connection will fail
even if |oci_set_edition| returns success.

When using persistent connections, if a connection with the requested edition
setting already exists, it is reused. Otherwise, a different persistent
connection is created

{edition} Oracle Database edition name previously created with the SQL "CREATE
EDITION" command.

This function is available from Oracle 11gR2 onwards.

To avoid inconsistencies and unexpected errors, do not use ALTER SESSION SET
EDITION to change the edition on persistent connections.

To avoid inconsistencies and unexpected errors when using editions and DRCP
with Oracle 11.2.0.1, keep a one-to-one correspondence between the
oci8.connection_class and the edition name used by applications. Each pooled
server of a given connection class should only be used with one edition. This
restriction has been removed with Oracle 11.2.0.2.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

<?php >
  // File 1
  
  echo "Version 1 of application\n";
  
  oci_set_edition('ORA$BASE');
  $c = oci_connect('hr', 'welcome', 'localhost/XE');
  
  $s = oci_parse($c, "begin :r := myfunc(); end;");
  oci_bind_by_name($s, ":r", $r, 20);
  oci_execute($s);
  echo "The result is $r\n";
?>

<?php >
  // File 2
  
  echo "Version 2 of application\n";
  
  oci_set_edition('E1');
  $c = oci_connect('hr', 'welcome', 'localhost/XE');
  
  $s = oci_parse($c, "begin :r := myfunc(); end;");
  oci_bind_by_name($s, ":r", $r, 20);
  oci_execute($s);
  echo "The result is $r\n";
?>
