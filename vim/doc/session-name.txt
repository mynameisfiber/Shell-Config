*session_name* -- Get and/or set the current session name

  string session_name([string name])~

|session_name| returns the name of the current session. If {name} is given,
|session_name| will update the session name and return the old session name.

The session name is reset to the default value stored in session.name at
request startup time. Thus, you need to call |session_name| for every request
(and before |session_start| or |session_register| are called).

{name} The session name references the session id in cookies and URLs. It
should contain only alphanumeric characters; it should be short and
descriptive (i.e. for users with enabled cookie warnings). If {name} is
specified, the name of the current session is changed to its value.

The session name can't consist of digits only, at least one letter must be
present. Otherwise a new session id is generated every time.

Returns the name of the current session.

|session_name| example

<?php >
  /* set the session name to WebsiteID */
  
  $previous_name = session_name("WebsiteID");
  
  echo "The previous session name was $previous_name<br />";
?>
