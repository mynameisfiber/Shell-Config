*imagecolorresolve* -- Get the index of the specified color or its closest
possible alternative

  int imagecolorresolve(resource image, int red, int green, int blue)~

This function is guaranteed to return a color index for a requested color,
either the exact color or the closest possible alternative.

If you created the image from a file, only colors used in the image are
resolved. Colors present only in the palette are not resolved.

{ image}An image resource, returned by one of the image creation functions,
such as |imagecreatetruecolor|.

{red} Value of red component.

{green} Value of green component.

{blue} Value of blue component.

Returns a color index.

Using |imagecoloresolve| to get colors from an image

<?php >
  // Load an image
  $im = imagecreatefromgif('phplogo.gif');
  
  // Get closest colors from the image
  $colors = array();
  $colors[] = imagecolorresolve($im, 255, 255, 255);
  $colors[] = imagecolorresolve($im, 0, 0, 200);
  
  // Output
  print_r($colors);
  
  imagedestroy($im);
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Array
  (
      [0] => 89
      [1] => 85
  )
